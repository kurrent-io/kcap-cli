/// (it survived 12 consecutive runs of the concurrent end-to-end test). That is exactly why the
/// guarantee is asserted directly here rather than through a flaky repro.</para>
/// <para>The exclusion tests assert ORDERING — the second holder entered only after the first released
/// — rather than an elapsed-time bound on the operation itself. That is strictly stronger, but be clear
/// about the residual assumption: the second acquisition must reach the semaphore within the settle
/// window below, or the expected order would also appear WITHOUT exclusion. There is no seam to observe
/// "reached the gate", so the window is sized generously against work that takes microseconds. Mutation
/// testing is what shows these assertions bite: deleting the gate fails all three, but only because the
