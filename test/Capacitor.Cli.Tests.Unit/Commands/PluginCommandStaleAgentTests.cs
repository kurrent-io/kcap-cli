/// <remarks>
/// The detector's own tests are a pure function of injected delegates, so they stay green whether or
/// not anything calls it. These pin the call site, and the re-install case in particular — dating
/// staleness from the installed file's mtime looked right and told every long-installed user their
/// working session was uncaptured, on every re-run and on every npm upgrade.
/// <para>
/// Every passing case seeds the agent JSON, because a genuine clone shells out to kiro-cli. The
/// marker is what separates the two shapes: a file without one is kcap's first install, a file with
/// one is a re-install.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
// PATH is process-global: the fresh-install precheck resolves `kcap` through it, and every spawned
// child inherits it.
