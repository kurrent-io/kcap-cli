/// <c>daemon stop</c> must refuse to kill a PID that is this very process.
///
/// <para>This is a REGRESSION test for a real kcap-cli CI failure, and it reproduces it exactly
/// rather than approximating it. A live <see cref="Capacitor.Cli.Daemon.DaemonLock"/> writes the acquiring process's own
/// pid and start token, so after acquiring one here, the daemons directory contains a pid file that
/// names the test runner. Every identity check in <c>StopByName</c> then legitimately passes — the
/// process exists, and its start token matches — and the old code proceeded to
/// <c>Process.Kill(entireProcessTree: true)</c> on itself, which .NET refuses with
/// <c>InvalidOperationException: Cannot be used to terminate a process tree containing the calling
/// process</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>The point worth keeping: the pid was never stale or recycled, so no amount of extra
/// validation could have caught it. A daemon simply is never the process running <c>daemon stop</c>,
/// which is why identity is the wrong question and self-reference is the right one.</para>
///
/// <para>In CI this arrived as a random <c>UninstallCommandTests</c> failure — uninstall runs
/// <c>daemon stop --yes</c>, which enumerates the daemons directory, and that suite was reaching the
/// runner's own. Isolating the directory is what closes that hole; this test covers the production
/// behaviour on its own, so the guard survives even if the isolation is later refactored away.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Mutation evidence, stated precisely.</b> Removing BOTH the self-pid guard and the
/// <c>InvalidOperationException</c> catch fails this test with the exact CI error
/// ("Cannot be used to terminate a process tree containing the calling process"). Removing either
/// one ALONE does not — the other still returns a clean exit code. That is deliberate: they are two
/// layers over the same hazard, the second covering the ancestor case that cannot be detected
/// portably in advance. So this test pins the PROPERTY (a self-referencing pid file never escapes as
/// an unhandled exception) rather than either individual guard, and it is worth knowing that is what
/// it does — a future reader deleting one layer will not be told by this test.</para>
