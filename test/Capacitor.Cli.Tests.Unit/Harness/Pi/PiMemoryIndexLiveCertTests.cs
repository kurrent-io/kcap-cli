/// <c>ctx.sessionManager.getSessionFile()</c> matching the cached session file. A renamed lifecycle
/// event, a <c>before_agent_start</c> payload that stops carrying <c>systemPrompt</c>, or a
/// <c>getSessionFile()</c> that returns something else on a future Pi build would silently stop
/// delivery while every unit test in this suite still passed — those tests assert the bytes kcap
/// writes and the text of the extension we generate, never what Pi's runtime does with either. Cursor
/// is the standing counterexample in this epic: byte-perfect output, model receipt not guaranteed.
/// Nothing except this test would notice.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Session identity is the session FILE PATH</b> (<c>PiHookCommand.ExtractSessionId</c>): the
/// header's uuid when the session's first line has been flushed, else the uuid suffix of the
/// <c>&lt;timestamp&gt;_&lt;uuid&gt;.jsonl</c> filename. The readiness probe below constructs throwaway
/// filenames of that exact shape for the same reason the OpenCode cert mints throwaway session ids —
/// each probe must resolve to an identity kcap has never seen, so it spends its own once-per-session
/// lease rather than the cert's.</para>
///
/// <para><b>No <c>VerifiedFloor</c> baseline yet.</b> Unlike the OpenCode cert, this file has never
/// been run against a live <c>pi</c> + installed extension — the substitution work that produced it was

///
/// <para><b>The <c>-p</c> stdout-shape assumption is GUARDED, not just disclosed.</b> The positive case

/// <c>type: "text"</c> NDJSON frames. Because that structural defense has no Pi equivalent, the positive
/// case instead asserts, BEFORE the nonce assertion, that raw stdout does NOT contain
/// <see cref="MemoryIndexEmitter.FragmentMarker"/>: if a future <c>pi</c> build ever echoed the injected
/// system prompt, the marker would ride along with the nonce and turn what would otherwise be a silent
/// vacuous pass (the negative control cannot catch this — it has no fragment to echo) into a loud,
/// diagnosable failure. That guard is necessarily partial — a reformatted echo that drops the literal
/// marker text would not trip it — so the deferred first live run must still eyeball raw stdout by eye,
/// not just trust the guard.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Known flakiness, and which kind it is.</b> Per the shared harness's <c>PositivePrompt</c>,
/// the positive case asks the model to echo 32 random hex characters; a small/free model can
/// mistranscribe them. That is a model-capability flake, not a delivery defect — see
