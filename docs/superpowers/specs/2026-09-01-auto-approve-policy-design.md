# Auto-approve policy: vendor-agnostic three-outcome approvals

**Issue:** [kcap-cli#738](https://github.com/kurrent-io/kcap-cli/issues/738) (supersedes AI-57)
**Status:** draft for review

## Problem

Every supported harness ships some form of auto-mode, but each is a per-vendor, per-machine
mechanism: incompatible configuration dialects, no knowledge of the org → team → project → repo
hierarchy, no central audit, and — critically — a binary allow/deny classifier. A silent deny sends
the agent into workaround spirals, so the human ends up watching the session *more* closely than in
manual mode. The interesting middle — "a human would want to see this one" — has nowhere to go.

Capacitor can provide what no vendor can: one approval policy with identical semantics across all
harnesses, rules and LLM judge prompts authored by the user and scoped to org, team, project or
repo, a third **ask** outcome, and every decision recorded for post-hoc audit.

## Goals

1. Three-outcome policy per tool call: **allow** / **deny** / **ask**, evaluated with one semantics
   everywhere; per-vendor *enforcement coverage* is advertised explicitly (see Seams) and the UI
   never presents coverage a seam has not verified.
2. Two layers in one policy: deterministic rules (fast, local, offline-capable) and a server-side
   LLM classifier with user-authored prompts (the judge).
3. Scoped governance: org, team and project policies authored in the app and server-stored; repo
   policy as a PR-reviewable file in the repo.
4. Ask escalation that reaches the human where they are: the vendor-native prompt locally, the
   existing PermissionRequest long-poll lane for hosted sessions.
5. Every policy decision recorded with provenance from the first shipped phase: rule decisions
   deterministically **replayable**, judge decisions **auditable** — their exact recorded input and
   output reconstructable, though an LLM verdict itself is not re-derivable.

## Non-goals

- Rebuilding the vendors' sandbox / command-safety cores. The **vendor-immutable layer** — a
  vendor's own sandbox, safety refusals, and anything it decides before exposing a decision point
  to us — is never overridden: a policy allow cannot resurrect an action that layer refused,
  because we are only consulted at decision points the vendor exposes. (kcap's own ACP launch
  presets are *not* this layer — see Hosted sessions.)
- Remote answering of a *local* terminal's ask. The plumbing would allow it (the blocking lane
  exists), but the terminal prompt and the app would race for the same answer. Local asks are
  answered in the terminal; the app gets a notification only.
- An agentic reviewer (Codex-Guardian style, with shell access and a 90 s budget). The judge is a
  single-shot classifier.
- Binding a hostile *local user*. Client-side enforcement cannot survive a user who removes or
  bypasses kcap; strict governance (below) defends against drift, cache loss and accidents after
  enrollment — not against the machine's own operator, and not before the first successful org
  fetch.
- Enforcing org denies the client has never received. When no valid org snapshot is available, an
  unmatched action passes through and the vendor's native auto-mode may run it; kcap cannot apply
  a rule it does not hold. Strict mode narrows kcap's own grants in that state (see Governance
  modes); it does not conjure the missing ceiling.

## Canonical actions

Every vendor payload is normalized before any policy sees it. The policy engine is vendor-neutral
Core code; normalizers live per vendor in `Harness/<Vendor>/`, extending the existing hook parsers.

```
CanonicalAction
  kind: shell | file_edit | file_read | network | mcp_tool | other
  vendor, session context (repo root, cwd)
  shell:      command (raw string), analyzed: bool, segments[] { program, argv } when analyzed
  file_*:     paths[]
  network:    host (lowercase, punycode-normalized), optional port, raw url
  mcp_tool:   server, tool
  other:      raw vendor tool name + payload (the escape hatch — unmapped tools stay governable)
  justification: vendor-provided reason for the call, when the harness carries one
```

**Normalization never fails open.** A payload the normalizer cannot map, a mapping that throws, or
an action with an empty component set where one is required (a shell action with zero segments, a
file action with no paths) yields `kind: other` with the raw payload — so `other`-kind rules still
apply and a governance deny still binds. There is no path from a normalizer error to a skipped
evaluation, and no vacuously-covered action (see Merge rule).

**Conservative shell analysis — allowlist grammar.** A command is `analyzed` only when every part
of it is on this list, exhaustively:

- simple commands whose every token is a **literal word** — no `$`-anything (parameter, command,
  arithmetic expansion), no backticks, no glob metacharacters, no here-docs, no process
  substitution, no redirection of any kind, no backgrounding, no `eval`/`exec`, no nested shell —
  where the nested-shell ban is enforced as a **maintained list of known shell program names**,
  matched on the basename, extension-stripped and case-insensitively, against **literal argv
  tokens** in **any** position (so a wrapper like `env bash -c` or `sudo sh` cannot hide one). A
  wrapper that re-splits one of its arguments into a fresh command line hides the name *inside* a
  token instead, where no per-token check reaches it; the analyzer refuses the known such form
  (`env -S` / `--split-string`, in any spelling getopt accepts), and an unknown program taking a
  command-string argument is governed by the rules that govern that program. Recognition, not
  exhaustion: no static analyzer can name every interpreter. An interpreter outside the list stays
  analyzable and is allow-eligible exactly when the analyzed command is fully covered by the
  policy's ordinary allow patterns — whether a pattern names the interpreter, a glob spans its
  position, or a wrapper rule grants it argv — and every such pattern is a visible grant an author
  wrote into the file. What the maintained list guarantees is narrower and absolute: a **listed**
  shell name in any argv position, and every refused form (redirection, expansion, compound syntax,
  an `env` split-string), is never allow-eligible under any pattern. Deny/ask rules govern
  unlisted interpreters like any other program;
- joined only by top-level `&&`, `;` or `|`.

Everything else — including ordinary redirection (`git status > file` performs a write the argv
does not show) and unexpanded globs (the executed argv would differ from the matched argv) — is
**unanalyzed**: no segments, and normatively **never eligible for allow** — the one guarantee
obfuscation can never defeat. Unanalyzed commands are still matched best-effort against deny and
ask rules (see Matching).

## Policy documents

One document shape for all five scopes: org, team, project (server-stored, authored in the app,
requiring the corresponding admin/lead role — detailed RBAC lives in the server spec), repo
(`.kcap/approvals.yaml`, versioned and PR-reviewable), and user (`~/.config/kcap/approvals.yaml`).
The rules merge is order-independent; scope order matters only for judge prompt composition
(org → team → project → repo → user). `caps` and `enforcement` are server-scope fields: a repo or
user document containing them is invalid (see Failure taxonomy).

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - match: { kind: shell, command: "git push --force*" }
    outcome: deny
    reason: force-push goes through the PR lane
  - match: { kind: shell, command: ["git status *", "git diff *", "dotnet build *"] }
    outcome: allow           # the trailing * is the visible opt-in to arbitrary extra argv
  - match: { kind: mcp_tool, server: "kcap-*" }
    outcome: allow
  - match: { kind: shell, command: "gh pr merge" }
    outcome: ask
judge:
  mode: unmatched          # off | unmatched
  prompt: |
    Approve routine read-only git and build commands anywhere in the repo.
    Escalate anything touching CI config or release tags to ask.
caps:                      # server-stored scopes only
  narrower_widening: on    # off = repo and user scopes cannot widen: no allow rules, no judge
                           # enablement, and their judge prompts are excluded from composition
enforcement: best_effort   # best_effort | strict — org scope only; see Governance modes
```

`caps.narrower_widening` defaults to `on`; when any applicable server scope sets `off`, off wins
(tighten-only aggregation). With `off`, repo and user documents contribute **only deny and ask
rules** — their allow rules are ignored, their `judge.mode` cannot enable the judge, and their
prompts are excluded from judge composition — so a hostile branch cannot widen anything, by rule or
by judge steering. When the judge runs, the prompts of **all** scopes not excluded by caps
participate, regardless of which scope enabled it.

Document limits (validated before activation): ≤ 500 rules, ≤ 1 000 tokens of judge prompt, ≤ 32
patterns per matcher. The server refuses to activate an invalid org/team/project document
(validation errors are authoring-time, never session-time).

### Matching semantics (normative)

- Patterns are globs: `*` and `?` only, case-sensitive. An invalid pattern invalidates its document
  (see Failure taxonomy).
- A matcher field that is absent matches anything; a matcher field that is present fails against an
  action where that field is missing.
- `shell` matching is **token-wise against argv tokens**, never against a joined display string —
  an argument containing a space can never collide with two arguments. The pattern is split into
  tokens; `*`/`?` match within a token; a final bare `*` pattern token is a **rest token** matching
  zero or more remaining argv tokens. Anchoring and extent are **outcome-sensitive**:
  - **Allow patterns** are anchored at token 0 and require **equal token counts** unless the
    pattern ends in a rest token — broad auto-approval must be visible in the policy, never a
    default. `git status` allows exactly `git status`; `git status *` also allows
    `git status --porcelain`. This is deliberate: a prefix-default allow would silently authorize
    side-effecting suffixes like `git diff --output=<file>`, and command families grow flags over
    time.
  - **Deny/ask patterns** match a **contiguous token run starting at any position** (so
    `git push --force*` catches `git push --force origin main`, `git push --force-with-lease`,
    and an env-wrapped `env FOO=1 git push --force`). Over-triggering — denying an `echo` that
    merely mentions the tokens — is acceptable for outcomes that only tighten. `exact: true`
    additionally anchors a deny/ask pattern at token 0 with equal counts.
- `shell`, unanalyzed commands: never allow-eligible — that is the only guaranteed invariant, and
  the spec claims no parity beyond it. Deny/ask patterns are evaluated best-effort against two
  representations: (a) **lexable literal fragments** — the raw string is conservatively lexed
  (whitespace runs collapsed, simple quoting resolved; ambiguous constructs abandoned) and
  deny/ask token runs are matched anywhere within the resulting fragment stream, which normalizes
  spacing and quoting differences; and (b) the **raw string as a substring glob** (implicit `*` at
  both ends) as an additional signal. Obfuscation can still evade both; what it can never do is
  earn an allow.
- `file_*`: paths are resolved absolute against the session cwd and lexically normalized (`.`/`..`
  collapsed; no filesystem access, no symlink resolution — symlink escapes are the vendor sandbox
  layer's concern, not this policy's).
- `network`: patterns match the normalized host; a matcher may pin a port. No redirect reasoning —
  we see the requested URL only.
- `mcp_tool`: `server` and `tool` are each glob-matchable fields.
- `other`: only the raw vendor `tool` name is matchable; the payload is deliberately not matchable
  in v1 (it has no canonical representation, and globbing raw JSON invites divergent
  implementations). An explicit `kind: other` allow rule is legal — it authorizes any payload of
  that tool, a coarse grant an author makes visibly or not at all.
- **Two component sets per action.** *Restriction components* are what deny/ask rules match
  (any-match); *coverage components* are what allow rules must fully cover. For analyzed shell,
  file, and scalar kinds the two sets coincide: segments, paths, or the single (server, tool) /
  host[:port] / tool-name component. An **unanalyzed shell action has one synthetic
  restriction-only component — its raw command string** — on which fragment hits, substring-glob
  hits, and coarse field-absent `{ kind: shell }` matchers all land, and an **empty coverage set**,
  so it is never allow-eligible. An `other` action whose payload carries no raw tool name gets a
  sentinel restriction component that field-present matchers never match but kind-level matchers
  do, **and an empty coverage set** — a normalization failure with no tool identity can be denied
  or asked about but never allowed, not even by a field-absent `{ kind: other }` allow; only an
  `other` action with a real tool name keeps its single allow-coverable component. No action has
  an empty restriction set.
- **Outcome-sensitive collection**: deny and ask are any-match over the restriction components —
  one hit suffices, so an unanalyzed command matching a fragment or raw deny *is* denied, not
  merely flagged. Allow is all-covered over the coverage components, which for the scalar kinds
  means their single component matches an allow rule.

### Merge rule: tighten-only with full coverage

Outcomes are ordered `allow < ask < deny`. All scopes evaluate independently; per action:

1. If any deny rule matches any **restriction component**, the outcome is **deny**.
2. Else if any ask rule matches any **restriction component**, the outcome is **ask**.
3. Else if the action has a **nonempty coverage set** (as defined per kind in Matching) and
   **every coverage component** is matched by an allow rule — every segment of an analyzed
   command, every path of a multi-path action, the single component of a scalar kind — the
   outcome is **allow**. An empty coverage set is never allow-eligible.
4. Else the rules layer yields **nothing** (the action proceeds to the judge, or pass-through).

Rule 3 is the coverage requirement: `git status && rm -rf x` with an allow on `git status` and no
match on the second segment is *unmatched*, not allowed. Partial allow coverage never authorizes.

Consequences: org deny + repo allow → deny; org allow + repo deny → deny; a wider scope cannot
guarantee an allow — central policy is a ceiling, never a floor.

### No match

When no rule decides and the judge is off or yields nothing: **pass-through** — kcap stays silent
and the harness's native behavior (its own auto-mode, allowlists, or prompt) decides. Enabling the
policy never makes a session noisier.

## The policy snapshot

All evaluation — local rules and the server judge — runs against one immutable **policy snapshot**
per session, so a decision's provenance is exact:

- Built at session start (at launch, for hosted sessions): fetch org/team/project documents from
  the server, read the repo and user files, validate, merge. The snapshot id is a content hash over
  every document plus the engine's canonicalization version.
- **Snapshot authority is split at the client/server boundary.** Server-stored scopes travel as
  references — (scope id, document version) — which the server verifies against its own store; the
  client never supplies org/team/project content, caps, or enforcement mode, so a local document
  cannot impersonate a server scope. Repo and user content is uploaded verbatim, labeled with its
  scope role, and confined to it. A snapshot whose server references do not verify is a
  policy-integrity failure: the judge is disabled for the session and the snapshot recorded as
  degraded. Audit records distinguish server-verified scopes from client-asserted local content.
- The snapshot is uploaded for **every session that emits policy decisions** — judge enabled or
  not — so evals can reconstruct the full competing rule set, not just the matched rule. Identical
  snapshots are stored once; offline sessions upload when the event queue drains. The judge
  composes prompts from exactly this snapshot, never from newer server state.
- The session runs on its snapshot until it ends. Mid-session edits — to the repo file, the user
  file, or the server documents — are inert until the next session. This is also the trust
  boundary for the repo file: what becomes live is what was on disk when the session the user
  started began, the same boundary as `.envrc` or committed hooks. A hostile branch can therefore
  put a widening rule or prompt in front of a user who starts a session on it; orgs preclude that
  with `caps.narrower_widening: off`, which removes both widening channels.
- Offline or fetch failure at session start: last-known-good cached server documents are used and
  the snapshot is marked degraded (see Failure taxonomy).

## The judge

A server-side single-shot classifier on kcap-server, consulted only when the rules layer yielded
nothing and a scope permitted to do so (see caps) enables `judge.mode: unmatched`. Keys and model
choice stay server-side.

**The judge is advisory, not a governance ceiling.** Hard limits are deterministic rules — that is
what makes them auditable, replayable, and immune to prompt injection. Scope prompts steer the
judge's judgment; they do not enforce. Two consequences the design accepts and states: a narrower
scope's allow rule (where permitted by caps) prevents the judge from running, and prompt
composition cannot mechanically guarantee that org guidance beats repo guidance — the base prompt
instructs that wider-scope guidance wins on conflict, best-effort. An org that needs a guarantee
writes a rule, or removes narrower widening entirely with caps.

**Standing permission vs turn authorization.** Scope prompts are *standing policy permission* —
like deterministic allow rules, they may justify an `allow` with no transcript at all, so a
windowless judge may allow from standing guidance alone. The transcript window informs
*turn-specific authorization* only: `user_authorization` may rise above `unknown` solely on
authenticated user-role content from the recording; a windowless verdict always carries
`user_authorization: unknown`. The untrusted-evidence framing binds the evidence blocks — no
evidence can claim user authority — not the authored scope prompts' standing permission.

### What the judge receives

The CLI (or daemon) sends `session_id`, the canonical action, the snapshot id, and a **turn
anchor**. The server assembles:

1. **Base prompt** — versioned, maintained in kcap-server.
2. **Scope prompts** from the verified snapshot (excluding caps-excluded scopes),
   org → team → project → repo → user, each in a labeled, structurally delimited block.
3. **Bounded authorization window, ≤ 2 000 tokens**, from the recorded session: the anchor user
   message, the last few user messages before it, and recent tool-call headlines (command/tool +
   target, no outputs). The window is built **only when action→turn lineage is established**: the
   vendor payload carries a parent/turn id the recording confirms, or the client's watcher
   correlation proves the anchor user message precedes this specific tool call. Freshness and
   recency checks alone are not lineage — a lagging watcher can present the previous turn as
   current — so when lineage cannot be established the judge runs windowless: a stale anchor is
   not evidence of authorization. The lineage result, freshness configuration and context-builder
   version are recorded in the decision's provenance. Role labels come from kcap's own
   authenticated recording, never from the request.
4. **The canonical action** and vendor justification, each field in its own delimited block.

**Budgets, deterministically allocated in this priority order**: base prompt and the complete
canonical action first; then scope prompts, dropping narrowest-first (user, then repo, …) so wider
guidance survives; then the window, dropping oldest-first. Total prompt ≤ 16 000 tokens; action
strings ≤ 4 000 tokens each; rationale ≤ 1 000 tokens. If any part of the **action** is omitted for
any reason — a per-string cap or the total budget — the action carries a machine-visible truncation
flag.

**Truncation clamp (mechanical, not prompt-disciplined).** When the action's truncation flag is
set, the server rewrites the verdict by this exact mapping, regardless of model output:
allow → ask; ask → ask; deny → deny; uncertain → uncertain (pass-through). A truncated action can
never be judge-allowed; restrictions are never weakened.

Every evidence block — window content, action strings, justification — is framed as **untrusted
evidence**: only user-role content from the recording can authorize; assistant or tool text never
self-authorizes; quoted material inside a user message does not inherit user authority; elided
content is not presumed benign. (Codex's Guardian applies the same framing at 15× our window size;
we stay smaller because our judge answers in seconds, not 90.)

### Verdict

```
outcome:            allow | ask | deny | uncertain
rationale:          string (≤ 1 000 tokens)
user_authorization: unknown | low | medium | high
```

Output is validated strictly against this schema; anything malformed is `uncertain`. `uncertain`,
timeout, or transport error → pass-through. Budget: 2 s on local hook paths (configurable), 10 s on
hosted-lane paths where nothing waits on a hook timeout.

**Caching.** A verdict is reusable only for its exact decision function and evidence. Cache key:
`(session, snapshot id, classifier config, canonical action digest, window digest)`, where
classifier config covers every decision-affecting setting — base-prompt version, provider and
model deployment, sampling parameters, output-schema version, context-builder version. The window
digest freezes the evidence: if the window grows mid-turn, the digest changes and the verdict is
recomputed. Windowless verdicts are not cached. Concurrent requests for the same key coalesce
(in-flight deduplication); entries die with the turn.

**Audit artifact.** Each judge consultation persists its exact composed request as a
content-addressed artifact — the selected window event ids, truncation metadata, block structure,
and classifier config — referenced from the decision event, so the decision is auditable
independent of transcript retention.

The fail-open direction is deliberate and differs from Codex (whose Guardian fails closed to deny):
our judge sits *above* the harness's own safety layer, so pass-through lands on the vendor's native
behavior, not on "run it".

## Failure taxonomy

"Fail-open" applies to **classifier availability**, not to **policy integrity**. The classes:

| Failure | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Judge timeout, transport error, `uncertain`, malformed verdict | Pass-through; decision event recorded with the failure class |
| Server documents unreachable at session start | Last-known-good cached documents; snapshot marked degraded; recorded + surfaced to the user |
| No cached server documents at all | See governance modes below |
| Malformed repo or user file (invalid syntax, invalid pattern, or server-scope fields like caps/enforcement) | Document ignored; snapshot marked degraded; recorded + surfaced (its denies are lost, so the loss is loud, never silent) |
| Malformed server document | Cannot occur at session time — the server refuses activation at authoring time |
| Snapshot server-scope references fail verification | Judge disabled for the session; snapshot degraded; recorded + surfaced |
| Unsupported snapshot schema version | Treated as unreachable documents (last-known-good, degraded) |
| Normalizer failure or empty component set | `kind: other` canonical action — evaluation always happens |
| Cache corruption (snapshot cache) | Refetch; else the unreachable-documents row |

### Governance modes

The org document declares `enforcement: best_effort` (default) or `strict`. Neither mode can
enforce a rule the client does not hold (see Non-goals); the difference is what kcap itself grants
when the org snapshot is unavailable:

- **best_effort**: with no server documents and no cache (first run, cleared cache), the session
  proceeds on local scopes only, degraded, loudly. Org ceilings hold **only while a valid fresh or
  last-known-good org snapshot exists** — not before bootstrap, not after cache loss.
- **strict**: the client persists a strict-governance marker, keyed by (server, org id) beside the
  LKG cache, the first time it loads such an org document. From then on, any session that cannot
  obtain a fresh or LKG org snapshot runs in **tighten-only mode**: deny/ask rules from available
  scopes still apply, but the engine emits no allows and the judge is disabled — kcap grants
  nothing it cannot verify it is allowed to grant. Unmatched actions still pass through to native
  behavior; strict mode narrows kcap's grants, it does not create the missing ceiling. The marker
  is cleared when a fetched org document declares best_effort, and a first-ever session with no
  marker necessarily behaves as best_effort — pre-provisioning the marker (enrollment before first
  session) is deferred.

A degraded snapshot never silently drops a deny that *was* loaded, and every degradation is a
recorded, user-visible event.

## Seams

One engine, per-vendor translation. Each adapter declares its seam capability beside its
registration — the `LocalControlCapabilities` pattern: nothing advertised without a live handler —
and the app renders exactly the verified coverage. Seam classes:

- **Pre-decision seam** — consulted before the vendor decides anything (Claude PreToolUse). All
  three outcomes; silence = the vendor's native flow.
- **At-prompt seam** — consulted only when the vendor already decided to prompt (Claude
  PermissionRequest, Codex approval hook, Gemini hook decision, ACP `request_permission`).
  Allow/deny answer the prompt; ask and pass-through both leave the prompt standing (at a prompt,
  pass-through *is* ask).

### Outcome × native disposition

"Native" here is the **vendor-immutable layer** only (sandbox, safety refusals, auto-allow logic).
kcap's own ACP presets are not native — see Hosted sessions.

| Policy outcome | Native would auto-allow | Native would prompt | Native refuses (before or after us) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allow | runs (pre-decision seam skips the vendor's permission check; vendor's inner safety still applies) | prompt answered allow | refused — never consulted, or our allow cannot resurrect it |
| ask | pre-decision seam forces the prompt; at-prompt seam: prompt stands | prompt stands | refused |
| deny | denied with reason | prompt answered deny (the agent's reject option) | refused |
| pass-through | runs (native behavior) | prompt stands | refused |

**Degradation:** a seam that cannot express an outcome degrades it toward pass-through, never
toward deny. Concretely: ask on a seam with no force-prompt ability (every at-prompt seam when the
vendor auto-allowed — the call never reaches us) is simply unenforceable there, and the capability
matrix says so. The audit event records both the **requested** outcome and the **effective**
behavior, so a degraded ask never reads as if execution actually paused.

### Local interactive sessions

| Vendor | Seam | Class | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | PermissionRequest hook (installed today, decision-capable) | at-prompt | yes — the rendered path uses it |
| Claude | PreToolUse hook (new plugin entry) | pre-decision | yes — certified against a live session in `default` permission mode (#738); carries `tool_use_id`, which PermissionRequest does not |
| Codex | approval hook | at-prompt (sandboxed auto-runs never reach us) | seam spike |
| Gemini | hook decision | at-prompt | seam spike |
| others | — | — | seam spike (#738) |

The seam spike also pins, per vendor, whether payloads carry a stable cross-seam call id and a
parent-turn id, whether hook delivery is ordered strongly enough for the FIFO fallback, and
whether every forced prompt reliably yields exactly one later at-prompt event (and whether
cancellation/completion is observable). **A vendor with neither sound correlation path does not
emit ask at its pre-decision seam at all**: a computed ask degrades there to pass-through
(requested ask, effective pass-through, both recorded), so no forced prompt can exist whose
stickiness the at-prompt seam cannot honor — the pre-decision seam owns this degradation. Ask
remains available at that vendor's at-prompt seam, where leaving the prompt standing needs no
correlation. The capability matrix advertises exactly this.

### The per-call decision journal (normative)

A local Claude call can traverse PreToolUse and then PermissionRequest; the journal makes the pair
behave as one decision:

- **Call identity**: the vendor's call id when the payload carries one — then every emitted
  terminal decision (allow, deny, or ask) is journaled and correlated exactly.
- **The two seams of one call need not agree on carrying an id.** Claude sends `tool_use_id` at
  PreToolUse and none at PermissionRequest, so the forced prompt arrives with no id for an ask
  that was filed under one. An at-prompt event with no id is therefore also held by any id-filed
  **ask** with its input hash — asks only, flagged ambiguous, aggregated under the fallback rules
  below. **The match finds the ask and never spends it**: a hash cannot say which of several
  identical calls a prompt belongs to, so a prompt the policy did not force (an identical call
  whose pre-decision evaluation differed, as a judge verdict can mid-turn) could otherwise take
  the guard and leave the forced prompt to a fresh evaluation that allows it. The entry goes with
  its own call id or with the turn, so the cost is extra prompts for that input until the turn
  ends, never a weakened outcome. An id-filed allow or deny is never reachable by hash, and an
  event that does carry an id never takes an ask filed under a different one: two ids are two
  calls.
- **Fallback without a call id — asks only, restrictive-safe, best-effort provenance.** Allow and
  deny emitted at PreToolUse normally prevent any later seam from firing, so journaling them would
  strand stale entries that a later *identical* call could wrongly consume — and a stale allow
  must never answer a prompt that a fresh evaluation would have asked about. The fallback
  therefore journals **only ask entries**, in an ordered pending queue per (session, input hash),
  with a guard that never replaces evaluation: the arriving PermissionRequest is **always
  evaluated fresh**, then the pending ask aggregates with the fresh outcome most-restrictively —
  fresh deny → deny; fresh allow, ask, no-decision, or evaluation error → the prompt stands (the
  pending ask suppresses auto-allow, never a deny). The head entry is consumed either way. A
  stale entry (a forced prompt the vendor never raised, a cancelled call, a failed hook) can
  therefore cost at most one extra human prompt and can never weaken an outcome in either
  direction; entries expire with the turn. Cross-seam
  **provenance under the fallback is best-effort**: the consumed entry may belong to a different
  identical call, so the decision event records both the stale-ask guard and the fresh
  evaluation's outcome under an explicit correlation-ambiguity flag instead of claiming exact
  per-call identity. Exact provenance exists only under vendor call ids. A PermissionRequest with
  no pending ask for its input is an ordinary fresh call.
- **Entries are consume-once.** A journaled **ask is sticky**: the forced prompt's
  PermissionRequest records and forwards but never auto-answers — the point of the ask was that a
  human decides.
- **Interactive sessions**: the engine decides at the earliest seam the call reaches. **Judge
  consultation counts follow the correlation quality**: under exact call-id correlation the judge
  runs at most once per call, at the earliest seam. Under the ambiguous FIFO fallback that
  guarantee is unattainable — the system cannot know whether an arriving PermissionRequest is the
  same call or a later identical one — so the fallback may consult the judge once at *each* seam,
  aggregating most-restrictively as above; a consultation satisfied by the verdict cache (same
  window digest) is recorded as cache reuse, while a changed window digest legitimately pays a
  second model invocation. Latency and cost expectations, and the audit trail, follow this
  per-seam accounting under the fallback.
- **Rendered sessions** (`KCAP_RENDERED_AGENT=1`): local seams invoke the engine in
  **tighten-only evaluation mode** — the same mode strict governance uses: only deny/ask rules are
  consulted, no allow is ever computed, and the judge never runs at a rendered local seam. There
  is consequently no suppressed allow to record or journal — a rendered local seam that finds no
  deny/ask has made no decision at all, so the audit contract (every engine decision recorded) and
  the journal stay consistent by construction. PreToolUse deny → emitted, terminal; PreToolUse
  ask → emitted, sticky, the prompt's PermissionRequest forwards to the human lane as today; no
  deny/ask → nothing evaluated, nothing emitted, no entry. The daemon path then runs the one full
  evaluation (rules, then judge — once per raised prompt, which the lane identifies exactly):
  policy allow/deny answer the lane, ask/no-decision park for the human.

### Hosted sessions

The decision transports all exist; the engine is inserted as a decision source in front of the
human lane at each existing choke point:

- **Hosted Claude** — the PermissionRequest long-poll: evaluate before parking the request; allow
  and deny answer through the same mechanism a human's click uses (deny maps to the agent's reject
  option); ask parks the request exactly as today. Ceiling enforcement on silently-allowed calls
  comes from the rendered tighten-only journal rules above, so no call class escapes both choke
  points.
- **Hosted Codex** — in-process app-server approvals: same insertion at the approval-request
  handler.
- **ACP vendors** — `AcpInteractionBridge` is already the single choke point. The launch presets
  (`explore`/`edit`) are **kcap's own configurable layer, not the vendor-immutable layer**, so
  ordering among kcap layers is a stated design decision: policy deny/ask are terminal (ask parks
  to the lane); a policy **allow deliberately takes precedence over the preset's would-prompt** —
  the merged scoped policy is the more expressive instrument, and the launch owner's own org/user
  scopes shape it; only a policy no-decision falls through to the preset, then to the lane. A
  preset can never widen a policy outcome. The vendor's immutable refusals happen before
  `request_permission` is ever raised and are untouched. Presets stay otherwise unchanged in v1;
  folding them into session-scoped rules is deferred.

Extras on these paths are small and none are transport: payload normalization, building the
session's snapshot at launch (the daemon knows the workspace), and provenance on recorded
decisions.

## Recording and audit

Every engine decision — allow, deny, ask, and every judge consultation including uncertain and
timeout fall-throughs — emits a session event carrying: the canonical action, the snapshot id, the
engine + canonicalization version, the seam, the requested and the effective outcome, the matched
rule + scope (or the judge verdict, rationale, user-authorization estimate, and a reference to the
judge audit artifact), the degradation flag, the failure class when one applies, and the journal
call identity as correlation id. Because the full snapshot content is persisted for every
decision-emitting session, rule decisions replay as a deterministic function of (snapshot, engine
version, action); judge decisions are auditable through their content-addressed request artifact
and recorded verdict. Pure pass-throughs (no rule, no judge) are counted, not individually
recorded; judge fall-throughs are individually recorded because they are the events evals must
find.

## Testing

- **Engine**: pure table-driven unit tests in Core.Tests.Unit — outcome-sensitive token matching
  (allow exact-or-rest-token, deny/ask any-position runs, `exact: true`), the lexable-fragment and
  substring-glob rules for unanalyzed deny/ask, per-kind component sets, the coverage rule
  (partial allow coverage never authorizes; empty component sets never allow-eligible),
  tighten-only merge, caps aggregation (any off wins), and the allowlist shell grammar pinned
  construct-by-construct, including that redirection, expansion and globs are unanalyzed and that
  unanalyzed commands never match allow.
- **Snapshot**: build/degrade/last-known-good table, both governance modes including the
  strict-marker tighten-only session and marker lifecycle (org switch, strict → best_effort), the
  server-scope reference verification failure, and the loud-loss rule for malformed files.
- **Normalizers**: fixture tests from captured real hook payloads per vendor, including the
  guaranteed `other` fallback and empty-component routing.
- **Seam adapters**: the existing hook-command pattern — stdin payload in, vendor decision JSON
  out — covering the outcome × native table and the journal state machine: consume-once, the
  ask-only FIFO fallback's restrictive-safety (a stale entry adds at most a prompt, never an
  allow) and ambiguity-flagged provenance, full journaling under vendor call ids, pre-decision
  ask degradation without correlation, and rendered tighten-only evaluation mode.
- **Judge client**: WireMock contract tests — timeout → pass-through, budget split, the full cache
  key (window digest recomputation mid-turn, windowless-uncached, config-version separation),
  in-flight dedup, the truncation clamp mapping, the lineage rule (no lineage → windowless), and
  per-seam consultation accounting under the fallback (cache reuse vs second invocation).
- **Integration**: one `KcapProcess` spawn covering the Claude PermissionRequest decision path
  end-to-end.

## Phasing

Each phase has an exit gate; a vendor's three-outcome coverage is never advertised before its seam
is verified against the outcome × native table.

1. **Engine + canonical actions + snapshot (local scopes, persisted) + Claude seams + provenance
   events.** Local Claude auto-mode ships, offline-capable, fully audited. Includes the
   hosted-Claude and ACP insertions — cheap once the engine exists. Gate: PreToolUse seam
   certified (including call-id and parent-turn-id availability); coverage rule, shell grammar and
   journal state machine verified end-to-end.
2. **Judge**: kcap-server classifier endpoint, snapshot upload + reference verification, prompt
   composition, lineage-gated window, cache, truncation clamp, audit artifact (server work tracked
   in Linear); CLI/daemon calls with fail-open budgets. Gate: windowless, no-lineage and degraded
   modes verified; judge events + artifacts visible to evals.
3. **Scoped governance**: server-stored org/team/project policies, authoring UI + roles,
   session-start fetch with last-known-good cache, caps, `enforcement: strict` + marker lifecycle.
   Gate: degraded-snapshot UX and tighten-only-mode session verified.
4. **Remaining vendors** per seam spikes, and the hosted Codex insertion. Gate per vendor: its
   truth-table row (and call/turn-id facts) verified before the capability matrix advertises it.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Partial allow coverage never authorizes: an action with any uncovered coverage component is at
   best unmatched; an empty coverage set is never allow-eligible; no action has an empty
   restriction set (unanalyzed shell gets its raw string, name-less `other` gets the sentinel).
2. An unanalyzed shell command never matches an allow rule; the analyzed grammar is an exhaustive
   allowlist (literal-token simple commands joined by top-level `&&`/`;`/`|`), so redirection,
   expansion, globs, here-docs, process substitution and backgrounding are all unanalyzed.
   A fragment or substring-glob deny/ask hit on an unanalyzed command produces that outcome
   through merge steps 1–2 — a matcher hit is a decision, not a flag. The spec claims no
   evasion-proof parity beyond the allow-ineligibility guarantee.
3. An allow pattern authorizes extra argv only through an explicit trailing rest token; without
   one it requires equal token counts. Deny/ask patterns match a contiguous token run at any
   position.
4. A wider scope's deny cannot be overridden by any narrower scope, the judge, or a preset.
5. `caps.narrower_widening: off` removes every widening channel of repo/user scopes: allow rules,
   judge enablement, and prompt participation. Any applicable `off` wins.
6. A judge verdict is never reused outside its (session, snapshot, classifier config, action,
   window digest); a truncated action is never judge-allowed (allow → ask; ask/deny/uncertain
   unchanged); a verdict without established action→turn lineage is windowless and uncached.
7. Every degradation is a recorded, user-visible event; no policy-integrity failure silently
   removes a loaded deny; under strict governance, a session without a valid org snapshot emits no
   allows and runs no judge.
8. A rendered session's local seams run in tighten-only evaluation mode: only deny/ask rules are
   consulted, no allow is ever computed (so none exists to record or journal), and the judge never
   runs there.
9. Requested and effective outcomes are both recorded whenever they differ.
10. Journal entries are consume-once. With a vendor call id, all terminal decisions journal with
    exact per-call provenance. The no-id fallback journals asks only and never replaces
    evaluation: the arriving event is evaluated fresh and the pending ask aggregates
    most-restrictively — a fresh deny still denies; every other fresh outcome leaves the prompt
    standing — so a stale entry can cost a prompt but can never weaken an outcome in either
    direction. Fallback provenance is best-effort, recorded with an ambiguity flag alongside both
    the guard and the fresh outcome, never claimed exact. An ask filed under a call id still holds
    the prompt it forced when that prompt arrives with no id, and — the one exception to
    consume-once — a hash-only match never spends it: it holds every id-less prompt for that input
    until its own call id or the turn's end removes it. An id-filed allow or deny is never taken by
    hash.
11. A pre-decision seam without a sound correlation path never emits ask: the ask degrades to
    pass-through at that seam (requested and effective both recorded), and ask stays available at
    the vendor's at-prompt seam.
12. A local document impersonating a server scope (or carrying caps/enforcement) is rejected as
    malformed; unverified server-scope references disable the judge for the session.

## Deferred

- Per-scope caps on judge outcomes beyond `narrower_widening` (e.g. "the judge may at most ask").
- Pre-provisioned strict-governance markers (enrollment before the first session).
- Remote answering of local asks (dual-surface racing needs a design of its own).
- Folding ACP launch presets into session-scoped rules.
- A configurable no-match default per policy (`unmatched: ask` for sensitive repos) — the schema
  admits it later; v1 is pass-through only.
- Mid-session policy refresh (sessions run on their start snapshot).
