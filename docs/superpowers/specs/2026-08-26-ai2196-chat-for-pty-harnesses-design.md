# Chat for PTY harnesses, rendered from the transcript (AI-2196)

Slice of the desktop shell (parent AI-2171; design canvas "Hosted Agents Shell",
Session artboard — the Chat tab and the composer). A Claude or interactive Codex
session gets a **Chat** tab beside its Terminal tab, rendered from the transcript
file the vendor itself writes; input still goes to the PTY. The same session, read
two ways.

Out of scope, by prior decomposition and by the canvas annotations: structured
turn frames, the "NEEDS YOU" approval card, permission-mode control and the "+"
attachment affordance (AI-2197); chat for ACP / app-server sessions, which have
no PTY and no transcript file the daemon locates (AI-2197); the work-context
sidebar (AI-2198). Deferred within this slice: markdown images,
syntax highlighting in code blocks, and rendering thinking or tool-result bodies.

## Decisions

Settled with the owner during brainstorming, 2026-08-26:

1. **The daemon tells the app where the transcript is: additive `transcript_path`
   on `AgentStatusDto`.** The daemon already resolves every PTY agent's vendor
   session id by scanning the vendor's session tree (a 2 s poll for up to 3 min)
   and caches the Codex rollout path for its own turn diagnostic; the agent's
   worktree — `<repo>/.capacitor/worktrees/agent-<guid>` — never reaches the app
   and cannot be reconstructed from `RepoPath`. Rejected: shipping session id plus
   worktree path and porting both locators into Core (duplicates work the daemon
   does anyway); a client-side scan of the repo's Claude project dir (ambiguous
   with two agents on one repo, and no Codex equivalent without the session id).
   "No protocol change" is read as AI-2195 read it: no new frame family; trailing
   nullable DTO members are the sanctioned path.
2. **The transcript → chat projection lives in Core, public, and emits
   `AcpEventEnvelope`.** `AcpEventKind` is the vocabulary the daemon's ACP and
   app-server runtimes already emit live and the one AI-2197's frames would carry,
   so the Chat tab's renderer is written once. Core has the internal
   `JsonElementExtensions` the repo mandates for JSON access; BCL plus
   `JsonDocument` keeps it AOT-clean. Rejected: app-local mappers behind an
   `InternalsVisibleTo` on a production assembly; daemon-side projection pushed
   over a new frame (that *is* AI-2197).
3. **The composer sits on the Chat tab only.** The canvas draws it under both
   tabs, but the Terminal tab is its own input surface — a second one beneath it
   would be two ways to type into one process. Recorded as a deliberate
   deviation from the artboard.
4. **Markdown: Markdig plus an in-house renderer.** `Avalonia.Controls.Markdown`
   is AvaloniaUI's commercial Accelerate control (license key in the csproj — not
   for a public repository); `Markdown.Avalonia` is an Avalonia-12 alpha with no
   cut since April 2026 and a single author; `LiveMarkdown.Avalonia` brings
   TextMateSharp and its grammar bundle. Markdig (BSD-2, 74M downloads, no
   dependencies) parses; a small renderer maps the constructs agents actually
   emit to Avalonia inlines and blocks, and anything it does not know renders as
   its literal text rather than vanishing.
5. **Chat is the default tab for a PTY session** (the canvas selects it on every
   rail click). The Terminal stays attached while Chat is up — the composer needs
   the live PTY link, and a reattach would only replay scrollback anyway.
6. **Thinking and tool-result bodies are not rendered.** The canvas timeline is
   user bubbles, assistant prose and one muted row per tool call; a tool row
   carries a one-line detail from its input and an outcome mark that its result
   flips. Thinking is projected (the vocabulary has it) and dropped by the tab.

## 1. Wire change (additive only)

`AgentStatusDto` (`src/Capacitor.Cli.Core/LocalIpc/StatusIpc.cs`) gains one
trailing member after `Title`:

- `TranscriptPath` — `string? TranscriptPath = null`, serialized
  `transcript_path`, always emitted (null, never omitted — the context's own
  rule). The daemon stamps `AgentInstance.TranscriptPath` in
  `SnapshotAgentsForStatus`. `null` means any of: an older daemon; not resolved
  yet; the 3-minute poll gave up; a runtime with nothing to read (app-server
  Codex, every ACP vendor); a local passthrough launch that resumes an existing
  session the locator cannot claim (below); or an agent that exited before discovery found its
  file or before the status push carrying the path was delivered — a 250 ms
  debounce sits between a pulse and its snapshot, and cleanup and removal can
  land inside it. The app never distinguishes these; it waits.

Daemon side (`src/Capacitor.Cli.Daemon`):

- `AgentInstance.CodexRolloutPath` becomes `TranscriptPath`, populated for both
  PTY vendors; the Codex turn diagnostic reads the renamed property unchanged.
- `SessionTranscriptLocator` (`Harness/Claude/`) gains
  `TryLocateWinner(projectDir, worktreePath, spawnedAtUtc, ruledOut)` returning
  `(SessionId, Path)?`, mirroring `CodexSessionRolloutLocator.TryLocateWinner`;
  `TryLocate` delegates to it. **The returned path is link-resolved**: the
  per-worktree project dir is a symlink onto the source repo's dir that
  `ClaudeLauncher.Cleanup` deletes when the agent exits, so a path through the
  link would die with the process while the file lives on. The winner is
  `Path.Combine(<link target of projectDir, final>, <matched file name>)`; a
  project dir that is a real directory (a borrowed checkout, or no symlink
  because the source project dir did not exist at launch) resolves to itself.
- **Every PTY launch runs the locator**, not only server-driven ones:
  `HandleLocalSpawnAsync` (a `kcap agent start`, `--private` included) captures
  the spawn time before `Spawn` and starts the same detection. A `--private`
  agent skips the server reports as today; the path is local state.
- The poll is extracted into an internal `TranscriptDiscovery` unit over a
  `TimeProvider` (interval, deadline, cancellation, the vendor's locate
  function, and the two callbacks it drives) so it is tested directly. It runs
  **until the path is known**, not until a session id exists; on a winner it
  sets `SessionId` and `TranscriptPath` on the agent and pulses
  `_statusNotifier` **before** either awaited server report — mutation first,
  pulse second, the notifier's own contract, and the pulse must not wait behind
  a SignalR call that can stall on a reconnect. Cancellation (the agent's read
  loop ending) ends the poll without a final locate — an agent that exits
  between two scans keeps a null path, accepted rather than coordinated
  against the exit path. The path resolves within a few seconds of launch for
  both vendors (Claude writes its first record, with `cwd`, before its first
  prompt renders).
- **A resumed session is outside discovery unless the locator's own rules
  happen to admit it.** Passthrough args reach the vendor verbatim, so
  `kcap agent start codex -- resume …` and `… claude -- --resume …` are in the
  launch surface. Codex appends to the rollout it resumes — a file stamped
  before this spawn — and the Codex locator accepts only rollouts stamped at
  or after spawn; that rule is what keeps a user's older session in the same
  cwd from being claimed, and it is not weakened here. Claude's locator
  matches the `cwd` in a transcript's first fifty records against the agent's
  worktree and permanently rules out a file whose cwd differs, so a Claude
  resume is discoverable only when it resumes in the very checkout it was
  recorded in (a borrowed-cwd launch) — an owned-worktree resume has a new cwd
  and is never claimed. Every such launch leaves `transcript_path` null and
  Chat in `Waiting`; supporting resume means resolving the resumed id from
  the arguments, which this slice leaves alone.

The path is the daemon's view of the filesystem (its `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` /
`CODEX_HOME`), which is the correct one: it launched the process. Nothing else
on the wire changes; `FrameType` and the capability list are untouched.

Serialization acceptance (extends `StatusIpcJsonTests`): old JSON without the
member deserializes to `null`; a value and `null` both serialize with
`transcript_path` present, last, in the declared trailing order. The daemon
snapshot test (`AgentStatusSnapshotTests`) asserts the serialized payload
carries `null` before detection and the path after.

## 2. Core: tail and projection

### `JsonlTail` (`src/Capacitor.Cli.Core/JsonlTail.cs`)

Vendor-neutral, BCL-only, one instance per file, holding a byte cursor.
`ReadAppended()` is total — it never throws — and returns
`TailRead(IReadOnlyList<string> Lines, TailStatus Status, string? Failure)`
with `TailStatus` ∈ `Ok | Reset | Missing | Failed`:

- Opens `new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite | FileShare.Delete)`
  per call and closes it after. The trap named on the issue: `File.ReadAllText`,
  `File.ReadLines` and friends open `FileShare.Read`, which on Windows denies the
  agent the write handle to its own transcript — worst during its shutdown
  drain. Invisible on macOS/Linux; only the Windows CI leg catches a violation.
- `FileNotFoundException` / `DirectoryNotFoundException` → `Missing`, no
  lines, cursor unchanged. Any other exception (a sharing violation, an
  `UnauthorizedAccessException`, any `IOException`) → `Failed` with the
  message, no lines, cursor unchanged. Both are transient by contract: the
  next call retries from the same cursor, so a file that appears or becomes
  readable later is picked up without any consumer action.
- `Length < cursor` is a length regression — a truncation, or a replacement by
  a shorter file: the cursor resets to zero and the read reports `Reset` so
  the consumer clears what it rendered. **A replacement by a file of equal or
  greater length is not detected** and would be read from the old cursor; the
  tail promises no more than length regression. Both vendors append only, so
  this is a stated limitation rather than a handled case.
- Reads `[cursor, Length)`, splits on `\n` (a trailing `\r` is stripped), skips
  blank lines, and **holds back an unterminated final chunk**: the cursor
  advances only past the last `\n`, so the chunk is re-read whole once its
  newline lands. This is `WatchCommand`'s `Hold` policy, as a pure function
  (`SplitCompleteLines(ReadOnlySpan<byte>, out int consumed)`) the tail wraps.
  UTF-8 decoding is per complete line — a multibyte sequence cannot straddle a
  newline, so no decoder state carries over.

### Projection

One public seam:

```csharp
public interface ITranscriptProjection {
    IReadOnlyList<AcpEventEnvelope> Project(string line);   // stateless; empty for anything unparseable or uninteresting
}
public static class TranscriptProjection {
    public static ITranscriptProjection? For(string vendor); // ordinal-ignore-case; null for an unknown vendor
}
```

`ClaudeTranscriptEvents` (`Harness/Claude/`) and `CodexRolloutEvents`
(`Harness/Codex/`) implement it as singletons; `TranscriptProjection.For` is
the one registration site, so adding a vendor's transcript means a new
`Harness/<Vendor>/` file and one line there. Every envelope carries
`TimestampIso` when the record has a timestamp; `Seq` stays 0 — arrival order
is the order. Every JSON read goes through `JsonElementExtensions`, so a
wrong-typed field reads as absent rather than throwing; a line that is not a
JSON object projects to nothing. The extension gains one internal accessor,
`Prop(name) → JsonElement?` — the property of any kind, null when absent — for
the one place the typed accessors cannot serve: copying a non-object `input`
verbatim into its wrapper. No public surface changes.

Output invariants shared by both mappers:

- *Joining*: when several text blocks feed one envelope they are joined with
  `"\n"`.
- *Capping*: `ToolResult` longer than 4096 UTF-16 code units is cut so that
  the result **including** its trailing `…` marker is at most 4096 long, and
  the cut never lands between the halves of a surrogate pair — when the cut
  would, the high surrogate goes too and the result is 4095 long. The same
  rule the daemon's `TitleFromPrompt` applies at 80. Nothing else is capped.
- *`ToolInputJson` is always a JSON object string*, as `AcpEventEnvelope`
  documents. Anything that has to be built rather than copied is written with
  `Utf8JsonWriter` — never reflection-based serialization, because Core is
  `IsAotCompatible` and ships inside two AOT binaries.

`ClaudeTranscriptEvents`, keyed on the record's root `type`:

- `user` whose `origin.kind` is `task-notification` — a finished background task
  Claude Code injects as if the user had spoken: one `system_note` whose text is
  the `<summary>` in bold and the `<result>` as markdown, never a user message.
- `user`, not `isMeta`, not `isSidechain`: a string `message.content` is one
  `user_message`; an array yields one `user_message` per `text` block and one
  `tool_result` per `tool_result` block (`ToolCallId` = `tool_use_id`,
  `ToolIsError` = `is_error`, `ToolResult` = the block's `content` when it is
  a string, else its `text` blocks joined). Before emitting user text,
  `<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>` blocks and the local-command wrappers
  (`<command-name>`, `<command-message>`, `<command-args>`,
  `<local-command-stdout>`, `<local-command-caveat>`) are stripped; text that
  is blank afterwards is not emitted.
- `assistant`, not `isSidechain`: per content block — `text` → `assistant_text`;
  `thinking` → `assistant_thinking` (`ThinkingEncrypted` when the block carries
  no text); `tool_use` → `tool_call` (`ToolCallId` = `id`, `ToolName` = `name`,
  `ToolInputJson` = the `input` object's raw text; an `input` that is not an
  object becomes `{"input": <raw value>}`). `Model` = `message.model`.
- Everything else is skipped: `attachment`, `summary`, `system`,
  `file-history-snapshot`, `file-history-delta`, `mode`, `permission-mode`,
  `last-prompt`, `ai-title`, `atis-latch`, `worktree-state`,
  `queue-operation`, `progress`, and any type this build has never heard of.

`CodexRolloutEvents`, keyed on `type == "response_item"` and then
`payload.type`; every other envelope type (`event_msg`, `turn_context`,
`session_meta`, `world_state`, `compacted`,
`inter_agent_communication_metadata`) is skipped:

- `message` with role `user`: the `input_text` blocks joined → `user_message`,
  unless the text opens with an injected prelude (`<environment_context>`,
  `# AGENTS.md instructions`, `<turn_aborted>`, `<user_instructions>`,
  `<permissions instructions>`); role `assistant`: the `output_text` blocks →
  `assistant_text`; roles `developer` and `system` are skipped.
- `function_call` → `tool_call` (`ToolCallId` = `call_id`, `ToolName` = `name`,
  `ToolInputJson` = `arguments` when it parses as a JSON object, else
  `{"arguments": <the string>}`); `custom_tool_call` → `tool_call`
  (`ToolInputJson` = `{"input": <the raw input string>}`);
  `function_call_output` and `custom_tool_call_output` → `tool_result`
  (`call_id`; the `output` string, or its text blocks joined).
- `reasoning` → `assistant_thinking` (summary texts joined;
  `ThinkingEncrypted` when only `encrypted_content` is present).
- `agent_message` (inter-agent traffic) is skipped.

## 3. App: the Chat tab

### `ChatTabViewModel`

Constructed by `WorkspaceViewModel` for a PTY session only — the same gate as
the Terminal tab (`HostedHarnessCatalog.ShowsTerminal`) — once the first dto
resolves, because the projection is chosen by the dto's vendor. Ctor-scoped
like its siblings; `TeardownAsync` is its one exit and disposes every
subscription below. Inputs: agent id, `IDaemonClientService`, the sibling
`TerminalTabViewModel`, the `ITranscriptProjection?` from
`TranscriptProjection.For(vendor)` (null → the `Unavailable` phase), an
`IUrlOpener`, and a `TimeProvider`.

Phases (`ChatTabPhase`): `Waiting` (no `transcript_path` yet — muted "Waiting
for the transcript…"), `Reading`, `Missing` (the path exists on the wire but
not on disk — "The transcript file is missing"), `Unavailable` (a PTY vendor
with no projection — "No chat view for this harness"). A `Failed` tail read
keeps the current phase and items and logs its reason once per distinct
message to `Console.Error` (the app's diagnostic convention); the next tick
retries. A session that ends keeps its items and keeps polling until teardown:
the file outlives the process and may still receive its final records.

Every daemon-fed input goes through `ObserveOn(RxSchedulers.MainThreadScheduler)`
before touching bound state — the client's pump is a background thread. Two
subscriptions: `daemon.Agents.Connect()` filtered to the agent id (the path
watch, and the footer's model/status), and `daemon.Snapshots` (the advertised
vendor options behind the composer hint's vendor label). The first non-null
`TranscriptPath` starts the tail. **Path identity is part of the read
generation**: every distinct path, on the UI thread and in one step, bumps the
generation, clears the items and the pairing index, and installs a fresh
`JsonlTail`; a read or projection still in flight for the old path completes
under a stale generation and is discarded. A fresh tail starts at cursor zero
with `Ok`, which is why the reset belongs to the switch, not to the tail.

Poll: a `TimeProvider` timer every 500 ms (a tuning constant, not a contract).
A tick with a read still in flight is skipped. The read and the projection run
on the thread pool and never throw past the tick (the tail is total; a
projection fault is caught, logged once, and drops that line); the apply hops
to the UI thread through `Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync` and mutates nothing
unless the generation it captured is still current — `TeardownAsync` and every
path switch bump it.

Items — an `AvaloniaList<ChatItemViewModel>` exposed read-only and mutated on
the UI thread. A read's items are applied with one `AddRange` (one collection
notification per read, however many records the first read of a long
transcript yields), and `Reset` is one `Clear`. Four shapes:

- `UserTurnItem(Text)`: the canvas's right-aligned bubble, plain text.
- `AssistantTextItem(Text)`: markdown-rendered prose, one item per envelope.
- `SystemNoteItem(Text)`: a `system_note` — markdown in a muted card, left-aligned
  like assistant prose but framed, so a task notification reads as the
  system's word, not the user's.
- `ToolCallItem(Name, Detail, Outcome)`: the muted `›` row. `Outcome` is a
  bound property ∈ Running | Done | Error, flipped in place when the matching
  `tool_result` arrives (indexed by `ToolCallId`; an unmatched result is
  ignored). `Detail` is `ToolDetail.From(inputJson, repoPath)`: the first
  present of `description`, `command`, `cmd`, `file_path`, `path`,
  `notebook_path`, `pattern`, `query`, `url`, `skill`, `prompt`, `input`; its
  first line, trimmed to 80 characters with an ellipsis; empty when none
  applies. A path key under the session's repository reads relative to it —
  or to the daemon's per-agent worktree beneath it when the path is in one —
  as the web UI shows it, so the file name survives the cut.

`assistant_thinking` and unmatched `tool_result` envelopes create no item;
`Reset` clears the items and the pairing index.

The list is an `ItemsControl` whose control template is a `ScrollViewer`
around the `ItemsPresenter`, with a `VirtualizingStackPanel` items panel —
the shape Avalonia virtualizes; an `ItemsControl` dropped inside an external
`ScrollViewer` is measured at infinite height and realizes every item. Item
templates are per item type (`DataTemplates` keyed on the three shapes).

Follow-tail is a view concern that sticks to the bottom until the reader
leaves it: on every `ScrollViewer.ScrollChanged` that lands above the bottom,
the view scrolls to the new end unless a gesture of the reader's own — a
pointer press or release, wheel, scroll gesture, key or scrollbar drag inside
the list — landed in the same layout pass; a change that lands on the bottom
re-arms following. It is not a once-per-append scroll because the virtualizing
panel reports the extent as an estimate that a tall row corrects only once it
is realized — a single scroll to the estimated end lands short; re-evaluating
on each change converges instead. The decision cannot be read from the
change's deltas: a realized row changing height (a tool row marked as awaiting
permission, a group folding) makes the panel drop its anchor and re-place
every row from the average realized size, after which the presenter clamps or
anchor-shifts the offset by arbitrary amounts that look exactly like a reader
scrolling up. Only input tells the two apart, so a reader who scrolled up
keeps their offset untouched until they return to the bottom, and a layout
that moves a following reader off the bottom is always corrected. The hook is
attached when the list's template is applied, which for a surface built
before its first layout is later than its first rows, so the initial load
lands at the bottom through the same rule.

### Markdown

`MarkdownView` — a `ContentControl` with a styled `Text` property and an
`OpenLink` command property — rebuilds its `Content` (a vertical panel of
block controls) from a Markdig AST (default CommonMark pipeline plus
auto-links and pipe tables, with precise source locations so an unmapped inline can print its
own source text — no other extension) on every `Text` change. `MarkdownBlocks` maps: paragraphs and
headings → `SelectableTextBlock` with inlines (`Bold`, `Italic`, monospace
`Run` for code spans); a soft line break is a space, as CommonMark renders it,
and a paragraph with a top-level hard break is a vertical stack of one
`SelectableTextBlock` per hard-break-delimited segment — never a `LineBreak`
inline or a `\n` inside a `Run`, which Avalonia 12's line breaker never
finishes laying out under a height-unconstrained parent (any `StackPanel` or
`ScrollViewer`) — so selection stops at a segment boundary, and a hard break
nested inside emphasis or a link label degrades to a space; fenced and
indented code → a `Border`
around a monospace `SelectableTextBlock`; bullet and ordered lists → marker +
nested content rows; block quotes → a left rule beside the content; thematic
breaks → a hairline; a pipe table → a framed `Grid` with one row per source
row, a semibold header row, cells rendered through the same inline mapper with
the alignment the separator row declares, the widest column taking the
remaining width while the others size to content up to a cap, so a prose
column wraps inside the pane. A link is an `InlineUIContainer` hosting a link-styled
`HyperlinkButton` (accent, underlined, hand cursor) with **`NavigateUri` left
unset** — set, the control opens the URI itself and would bypass the policy
below — and `Command` bound to `OpenLink` with the URL as its parameter; a
button brings keyboard activation (Enter/Space), focus, and automation
semantics, which a bare inline `Run` has none of. HTML, images and any
other node render their literal source text — degraded, never dropped.
User bubbles do not go through it: what the user typed is shown as typed.

Links are agent-authored and untrusted, and `ShellUrlOpener` hands any string
to the OS shell. The trust boundary is **one** ctor-scoped
`ChatTabViewModel.OpenLinkCommand` — the items carry no command; every
markdown template binds to the tab's through the ancestor `DataContext`, so
policy, error containment and disposal live in one place rather than in
thousands of transcript items. It is backed by a pure
`LinkPolicy.IsOpenable(url)`: only an absolute `http` or `https` URI opens;
anything else (`file:`, `javascript:`, custom schemes, relative or malformed
text) renders as plain text with no link affordance at all. An opener
exception is caught and logged to `Console.Error` — a bad link never escapes
a UI event.

`Markdig` is added to `Directory.Packages.props` and the app csproj. The app
is not NativeAOT, so trimming is not a concern for it.

### Tab strip and workspace

`WorkspaceViewModel`:

- `Chat` (`ChatTabViewModel?`): created from the presence stream on the first
  dto that passes the PTY gate, disposed by `TeardownAsync`. Null for a
  non-PTY session, whose tab strip keeps today's muted note.
- `ActiveTab` (`WorkspaceTab.Chat | Terminal`), default Chat;
  `ShowChatCommand` / `ShowTerminalCommand`; `IsChatActive` / `IsTerminalActive`
  drive the pill styling. A new workspace (any `OpenSession`) opens on Chat.
- `ShowsChatTab` is `ShowsTerminalTab` — one gate, exposed once.

`WorkspaceView`: `ChatTabButton` precedes `TerminalTabButton`; a `ChatTabView`
(`ChatHost`) and the existing terminal grid share the content cell. Only one
control needs to exist off-tab: **`TerminalHost` stays laid out on both tabs**,
so the pane size it reports to the PTY is the real pane size whichever tab is
up. An `IsVisible=false` control is never measured: a workspace opened on Chat
would then keep the constructor's 80×24 and, through the daemon's min-clamp
across viewers, shrink the agent's terminal for every other attacher.

Everything else is collapsed when its tab is inactive: the chat surface
(list, composer, Send) and the terminal's banners and Detach/Reattach buttons
are `IsVisible=false` — still instantiated in the tree, but unmeasured, not
effectively visible, unfocusable, out of tab navigation, and reported
offscreen by their automation peers (the default derives that from
`IsVisible`). `TerminalHost` alone, when Chat is active, stays visible so it
is measured — disabled, non-hit-testable, transparent, and marked
`AutomationProperties.IsOffscreenBehavior=Offscreen`, since a
visible-but-transparent control would otherwise be announced beside the chat.
Focus follows the tab: the existing
focus-on-Model-assignment handler runs only while the Terminal tab is active
(a reattach while Chat is up must not steal the composer's focus); switching
to Terminal focuses the terminal, switching to Chat — and the first open on
Chat — focuses `ComposerInput`.

### Composer

Lives on `ChatTabViewModel`, sends through the sibling Terminal tab:

- `ComposerText`; `SendCommand` (`ReactiveCommand.Create`, synchronous),
  executable iff **`Terminal.CanAcceptText`** (the terminal-owned projection
  below — the one authority `TrySendText` itself consults, so can-execute and
  acceptance can never disagree) and the text is not blank. It calls
  `Terminal.TrySendText(text)` and clears the text iff that returns true —
  one synchronous step on the UI thread, no await, so acceptance and the
  clear cannot be separated by a state change. The send is
  **accepted**, not acknowledged: the attach seam's `SendInputAsync` returns
  nothing and Core's client no-ops when it is no longer writable and folds a
  transport failure into the attach outcome — so no send can learn whether
  its bytes landed. A refused send leaves the text in place and the hint
  already says why. A transport loss surfaces the way it always does — the
  attach outcome flips `Terminal.State`, and the hint follows.
- `ComposerHint` follows `Terminal.SendAvailability` (below), which folds
  the gate into the state so the hint is truthful in every window: `Ready` →
  "Reply to {vendor label} · Enter sends · Shift+Enter for a new line";
  `Sending` → "Sending…"; `Transitioning` (the gate is closed while `State`
  still reads Attached — a reattach or detach in progress) → "Updating the
  terminal connection…"; otherwise by `State`: attached read-only → "Read-only:
  {reason}"; `Resolving`/`Connecting` → "Connecting to the terminal…";
  `Detached`/`Failed` → "Reattach the terminal to send";
  `Exited`/`SessionEnded` → "This session has ended"; `NoTerminal`/`NotFound` →
  "No terminal to send to". The vendor label comes from
  `HostedHarnessCatalog.LabelFor` over the daemon's advertised options.
- Footer: model label (`HostedHarnessCatalog.ModelLabelFor`, "default" for
  none), the session's status dot (`SessionStatusDots.For`) and status word
  (the dto's `Status`, verbatim, like the Home cards). No permission-mode chip:
  reading or switching the mode is AI-2197's, and the transcript does not
  carry the live prompt state anyway.

`TerminalTabViewModel.TrySendText(string text)` → `bool`, synchronous, UI
thread. The terminal owns a **send gate** with three pieces of state, all
mutated only on the UI thread:

- `SendGate` ∈ Open | Closed, and the **opening token** — a counter whose
  current value names who may open the gate. Two operations, and only two,
  advance it, both synchronous on the UI thread:
  - `BeginAttempt()` — `TryStartAttemptAsync`'s first **state-mutating**
    action, after it has try-entered `_attachLane` and passed the
    disposed/retired guard, and still before any await: closes the gate,
    allocates a fresh token and hands it to the attempt, which carries it
    for its whole life. A call that loses the lane (a double-click —
    `ReactiveCommand.Execute` runs the handler even while one is active) or
    finds the VM torn down allocates no token and touches no send state; it
    is the complete no-op it is today, so the winning attempt's token stays
    current.
  - `Invalidate()` — closes the gate (an already-closed gate still counts:
    ownership must advance even mid-`Connecting`), allocates a fresh token
    that no attempt holds, and clears `SendInFlight`. Called at the start of
    `RunDetachAsync` and `TeardownAsync`, before any await; by the agent
    removal that lands `SessionEnded`; by the resolve timeout (`NotFound`)
    and the no-terminal note; and by every terminal outcome
    `FinishAttemptAsync` publishes (Detached, Exited, Failed, ConnectionLost).

  An attempt's **own** publishes never advance the token: its `Connecting`
  publish preserves it, and its read-write `Attached` publish **opens the
  gate iff the token it carries is still current** (a read-only Attached
  leaves it closed, token untouched). A carried token that is no longer
  current means an invalidation landed since — a cache removal or an explicit
  detach retires no attempt generation today, so a callback still queued for
  its UI dispatch when either lands would otherwise publish a writable
  `Attached` on top of the closure and reopen a terminal the daemon has
  already dropped. Only a later, explicitly begun attempt holds a fresh
  token and can open.

  The pre-`Connecting` window closes the same way: after `TryStartAttemptAsync`
  awaits the old client's disposal, it re-checks that the token
  `BeginAttempt` handed it is still current and aborts the attempt otherwise
  — an invalidation that landed during that await (a removal, a detach) must
  not be overridden by an attempt that never reached `Connecting`. `State`
  has one publish point that takes the publisher's token and applies these
  rules; nothing assigns it directly. Neither `State` nor `_client` can serve
  as the gate on its own: a reattach leaves both `Attached` and live while it
  awaits the old client's disposal, and a detach leaves both unchanged while
  it awaits the detach write — a send started in either window would
  otherwise be accepted against a client on its way out.
- `SendInFlight` (bound), true from acceptance until the delivery ends. A
  delivery captures the token at acceptance and re-checks it before its CR.

Two bound projections fold these together for the composer:
`CanAcceptText` = gate Open ∧ ¬`SendInFlight`, and `SendAvailability` ∈
`Ready | Sending | Transitioning | <by State>` — `Transitioning` being the
gate Closed while `State` still reads Attached. Both raise change
notifications on every gate, in-flight and state change.

`TrySendText` refuses (false, nothing written) unless `CanAcceptText`;
otherwise it captures the client and the token, sets `SendInFlight`, starts
the fault-contained background delivery, and returns true. One transaction
at a time is the point: two accepted sends inside the 150 ms window would
interleave as paste A, paste B, CR, CR — Core's client serializes single
frames, not multi-frame messages — and the TUI would submit both as one
prompt and spend the second Enter on whatever is up next. Refusing keeps the
second text in the composer for the user to send again a moment later.

Ownership of `SendInFlight` is one rule: **whoever advances the token
retires the send.** `BeginAttempt` and `Invalidate` both clear it
synchronously as they allocate, so a natural exit, an agent removal or a
reattach landing during the 150 ms delay kills the pending CR the same way
(its captured token is no longer current); the delivery's own completion —
success or fault — clears it through a UI-thread dispatch that mutates
nothing unless the token it captured is still current and the VM has not
been torn down, so a late completion can neither clear a newer send nor
touch a torn-down VM.

The delivery is the daemon's own `PtyHostedAgentRuntime.SendUserInputAsync`
shape: one write of `TerminalInputEncoder.Paste(text)` — `\r\n` normalized to
`\n`, one trailing newline dropped, wrapped in bracketed paste (`ESC[200~` …
`ESC[201~`) so the TUI takes it as one block — then, after a 150 ms
`TimeProvider` delay, one write of `\r` **to the same captured client, only if
the token is unchanged**. A stale token drops the CR: the paste already
went to the old client, and a replacement must never receive a stray Enter.
A fault in either write is observed and logged once to `Console.Error` and
ends the delivery (clearing `SendInFlight` under the rule above); it never
touches `State` — the attach outcome is the transport's own reporting
channel. The delay is measured against Codex's TUI, which suppresses
Enter-as-submit for 120 ms after ingesting a paste and turns a CR inside that
window into a newline. A single CR, never a retry spray: an interactive launch
keeps its permission prompts (Claude prompts unless it is an owned review-flow
launch; Codex follows its posture), and the transcript cannot show a prompt
that is up on the PTY, so every extra Enter is a chance to answer one. Every
message takes this one path, single-line or not. Enter sends and Shift+Enter
inserts a newline — a view-level key handler on the composer's `TextBox`.

## 4. Testing

`test/Capacitor.Cli.Core.Tests.Unit`:
- `JsonlTailTests`: complete lines delivered once; an unterminated final line
  held, then delivered whole after its newline; CRLF; blank lines skipped;
  length regression → `Reset` and a re-read from zero; missing → `Missing`,
  then the same tail reads the file once it appears; a transient failure →
  `Failed` with the cursor intact, then the next read succeeds; a file held
  open for writing by another handle (sharing read/write/delete, opened first)
  is still readable — the Windows sharing pin.
- `ClaudeTranscriptEventsTests` / `CodexRolloutEventsTests`: one fixture line
  per shape in §2 — including a string `tool_result.content` and a block-array
  one, a non-object `input`, non-object `arguments`, the skip lists, wrapper
  stripping, prelude skipping, the joining separator, the cap (final
  `string.Length` 4096 with the marker in the plain case, 4095 when an astral
  character straddles the boundary and its high surrogate is dropped, never a
  lone surrogate), wrong-typed fields reading as absent,
  and a malformed line → empty. Every `ToolInputJson` in every fixture parses
  as a JSON object; the wrapper fixtures cover an array, a scalar and a null
  `input`. `TranscriptProjection.For`: case-insensitive, unknown → null.
- `JsonElementExtensionsTests`: `Prop` returns an array, a scalar and a null
  property as elements, and null for an absent one or a non-object receiver.
- `StatusIpcJsonTests`: `transcript_path` round trip, trailing order, old JSON
  → null.
- AOT: the Release publish of the CLI stays free of `IL2026`/`IL3050`
  warnings (`dotnet publish -c Release … | grep -E 'IL[23][01][0-9]{2}'`), run
  as part of the slice's acceptance, not left to CI.

`test/Capacitor.Cli.Daemon.Tests.Unit`:
- `SessionTranscriptLocatorTests`: the winner carries the matched file's
  path; a winner located through a project-dir symlink reports the
  link-resolved path, and after the symlink is deleted (what `Cleanup` does)
  that path still reads, final append included.
- `TranscriptDiscoveryTests` (over `FakeTimeProvider`): a winner sets both id
  and path and pulses before the reports; a pre-populated session id with no
  path keeps polling until the path lands; the deadline ends the poll with no
  mutation; cancellation (agent exit) ends it cleanly.
- `AgentOrchestrator`: `HandleLocalSpawnAsync` starts discovery for a local
  (and a `--private`) PTY launch — over a fake PTY factory and launcher, no
  real process. Two resume launches pin the boundary so weakening it is a
  deliberate change: `codex -- resume <id>` against a sessions tree holding
  only the resumed, older-stamped rollout, and an owned-worktree
  `claude -- --resume <id>` against a project dir holding only the resumed
  transcript with its original cwd — both leave `transcript_path` null.
- `AgentStatusSnapshotTests`: `transcript_path` null before detection, the
  value after — on the serialized payload.

`test/Capacitor.App.Tests.Unit` (over `FakeDaemonClientService`,
`FakeTerminalAttachClient`, `FakeTimeProvider`, a `TempDir` transcript):
- `ChatTabViewModelTests`: `Waiting` until a path; the path starts reading and
  the initial load renders items in file order; lines appended after a tick
  render; a held partial line does not render until complete; tool outcome
  pairing (Done, Error); `Reset` on length regression; `Missing` then
  recovery; a `Failed` read keeps items and phase; a path switch with a read
  of the old file deliberately blocked mid-flight — switch, release, and only
  the new file's items remain, with an empty pairing index; ticks stop after
  teardown; a projection-less vendor → `Unavailable`; a removed agent keeps
  its items; a dto or snapshot pushed from a pool thread lands on bound state
  without a thread-affinity fault; both subscriptions end at teardown.
- Batching: a 5,000-record initial transcript raises exactly one collection
  notification, and — in a headless window at a fixed size — the
  `ItemsControl` realizes a bounded number of containers.
- Follow-tail (headless, laid out): the initial load ends at the bottom; an
  append while at the bottom ends at the **new** bottom after the layout
  pass; an append while scrolled up leaves the offset where it was; an append
  at the bottom followed by a scroll up before the layout pass completes
  leaves the offset up.
- Composer: `SendCommand` enablement across every terminal phase and the
  read-only case; the exact two writes via `FakeTerminalAttachClient.SentInput`
  — the bracketed paste, then `\r` only once the `FakeTimeProvider` advances
  past the delay, on the same client; a second send accepted before the
  first's CR is refused with its text intact, and once the first completes it
  goes through — the only order ever observed is paste A, CR, paste B, CR;
  a send started while a reattach is awaiting the old client's disposal
  (`DisposeGate`) or a detach is awaiting its write (`HangDetachForever`) is
  refused — `State` still reads `Attached` in both windows, `SendCommand`'s
  `CanExecute` is false and the hint reads "Updating the terminal
  connection…" — and the gate reopens only once the new attempt lands
  read-write `Attached` (a read-only Attached leaves it closed); the token
  protocol in its three cases — (a) a normal attempt keeps its token across
  its own `Connecting` publish and opens on `Attached`; (b) a removal, and
  separately an explicit detach, landing while the attempt is `Connecting`
  (its attach callback's UI publish still queued) advances ownership, so
  after the queue drains `State` is `SessionEnded` (respectively not
  Attached), `CanAcceptText` is false and a direct `TrySendText` is refused;
  (c) a removal or detach landing during a reattach's pre-`Connecting`
  old-client disposal (`DisposeGate`) aborts that attempt — it never
  publishes `Connecting` or `Attached` — while a subsequently, explicitly
  begun attempt holds a fresh token and does open; (d) the existing
  back-to-back reattach test grows a token assertion: with the winning
  attempt held in its first await, the losing call changes neither the
  token nor the gate, and once the winner publishes `Connecting` and
  `Attached`, `CanAcceptText` is true; a reattach
  whose old-client disposal
  is held open past 150 ms, a detach, or a teardown started during the delay
  sends no CR to any client and clears `SendInFlight` synchronously; an
  `AttachOutcome` (`Exited` and `ConnectionLost` at least) and an agent
  removal landing during the delay each close acceptance synchronously,
  clear `SendInFlight`, suppress the CR, and a direct `TrySendText` right
  after is refused; a faulting write clears `SendInFlight` and leaves `State`
  untouched; a retired delivery's completion cannot clear a newer send's
  `SendInFlight`; after `TeardownAsync` returns, no bound state changes and no
  dispatcher work is queued by a still-running delivery; the text clears on
  acceptance and stays on refusal; every hint string including "Sending…"
  and "Updating the terminal connection…"; a pool-thread state flip updates
  the hint on the UI thread.
- `TerminalInputEncoderTests`, `ToolDetailTests` (key priority, first line,
  80-character cut), `LinkPolicyTests` (https/http open, `file:`,
  `javascript:`, custom schemes, relative and malformed text refused).
- `MarkdownBlocksTests` (headless): paragraph inlines, a fenced block, list
  items, a link that executes `OpenLink` exactly once from a pointer click and
  once from keyboard activation, a disallowed link rendered as plain text that
  is not focusable, and an unsupported construct degrading to literal text.
- `WorkspaceViewModelTests`: Chat is the default tab; the switch commands; `Chat`
  is built for a PTY dto only; teardown disposes it.
- `WorkspaceViewSmokeTests`: the new names resolve (`ChatTabButton`, `ChatHost`,
  `ChatItems`, `ComposerInput`, `SendButton`); switching tabs flips which
  surface is visible while `TerminalHost` stays in the tree on both; a
  workspace opened on Chat with a **real** `XtermTerminalSurface` reports the
  laid-out pane size to the attach client, not 80×24, while `TerminalHost` is
  disabled and non-hit-testable and its automation peer reports offscreen;
  with Terminal active the chat surface is not effectively visible
  (`IsEffectivelyVisible == false`, the existing smoke tests' own probe) and
  its peer reports offscreen, and with Chat active the same holds for the
  terminal's banners and buttons; focus lands on
  `ComposerInput` on open, stays there through a late Model assignment, moves
  to the terminal on the Terminal switch and back on the Chat switch; tab
  traversal from the composer never reaches `DetachButton`/`ReattachButton`
  while Chat is active (terminal driven to Detached/Failed first), and from
  the terminal never reaches `ComposerInput`/`SendButton` while Terminal is
  active.

README: the desktop app has no section yet and this slice adds no CLI surface,
so it is unchanged. `docs/CHANGES.md` gains a "Session chat" entry.

## Risks

- **Transcript size.** The whole file is parsed at open. A multi-megabyte
  transcript costs one pool-thread pass and one `AddRange` into a virtualizing
  `ItemsControl`; accepted for now, and a tail-only initial load is the obvious
  upgrade if it ever hurts.
- **Agent-owned files.** Every open is `FileShare.ReadWrite | Delete`; a
  regression is invisible locally and reddens only the Windows CI leg. The
  sharing test in `JsonlTailTests` is the local guard.
- **Replacement is not detected.** The tail promises length regression only;
  a same-or-longer replacement reads from the old cursor. Both vendors append
  in place, so this is a documented limitation, not a handled case.
- **A send can answer a prompt.** Composer bytes are raw PTY input, and an
  interactive launch keeps its permission prompts, which the transcript never
  shows. The single delayed CR limits the exposure to one keypress, and the
  Terminal tab is where a live prompt is visible; only AI-2197's frames can
  close the gap. Bracketed paste assumes the TUI enabled it (both do), and
  the 150 ms paste-to-CR gap is calibrated to today's Codex suppression window
  — a TUI that widens it would turn a send into a newline, which the Terminal
  tab makes visible.
- **A borrowed-cwd local launch can mislink.** The locator disambiguates by
  cwd and spawn time; a user's own session started in the same checkout within
  the skew tolerance could win. Display-only, and the same exposure the
  daemon's session-id link already carries.
- **A short-lived session may never get its path.** Discovery scans every
  2 s and stops at agent exit without a final locate; and a path that lands
  at exit still has to cross the status debounce before cleanup and removal.
  Such a session's Chat stays in `Waiting` — its Terminal tab still has the
  scrollback. Coordinating discovery with the exit path was judged not worth
  its coupling for a session that ran for seconds.
- **Resume is mostly not discoverable.** A Codex `resume` appends to an
  older-stamped rollout the locator will never accept, and a Claude `--resume`
  into a fresh owned worktree carries its original cwd, which the locator
  rules out permanently; Chat stays in `Waiting`. Supporting resume means
  reading the resumed id out of the arguments, which this slice leaves alone.
- **Rendering granularity is the transcript's.** Both vendors write complete
  blocks, not tokens, so assistant text appears per block, a few hundred
  milliseconds after the vendor writes it. That is what "rendered from the
  transcript" means; token streaming is AI-2197's frames.
- **Markdown subset.** Unknown constructs degrade to literal text. Images are
  the likeliest gap and are deferred knowingly.
- **A never-resolving path** (older daemon, or the poll gave up) leaves Chat in
  `Waiting` with the Terminal tab one click away; the note says what it is
  waiting for.
