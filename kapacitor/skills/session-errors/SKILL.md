# Session Errors

Extract tool call errors from a Claude Code session recorded by Kurrent Capacitor. The output lists each failed tool call — bash commands, file reads/writes, agent delegations, etc. — along with the error message and the tool that caused it.

## Usage

Run `kapacitor errors` via the Bash tool. The session ID is automatically set by the `KAPACITOR_SESSION_ID` environment variable (persisted at session start).

```bash
# Errors from the current session
kapacitor errors

# Errors from the full continuation chain
kapacitor errors --chain

# Explicit session ID (overrides env var)
kapacitor errors <sessionId>
kapacitor errors --chain <sessionId>
```

## Output Format

Each error is printed as a block with:

- **Session ID** and optional **agent ID** (if the error occurred in a subagent)
- **Event number** and **timestamp**
- **Tool name** — the tool that failed (e.g., Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Task)
- **Error message** — the error output or failure reason

When using `--chain`, errors from all sessions in the continuation chain are included, ordered chronologically.

## When to Use Each Flag

- **No flag** (`kapacitor errors`) — reviewing errors from the current session
- **`--chain`** (`kapacitor errors --chain`) — reviewing errors across a full task that spanned multiple sessions

## Practical Applications

- **End-of-session review** — run after finishing a session to identify recurring mistakes and update CLAUDE.md with avoidance rules
- **Debugging** — quickly find what went wrong in a session without scrolling through the full timeline
- **Pattern detection** — use `--chain` across a multi-session task to spot repeated error patterns (e.g., wrong file paths, incorrect API usage)

## Environment

The `KAPACITOR_URL` environment variable overrides the default server URL (`http://localhost:5108`).

## Tips

- After extracting errors, look for patterns: the same tool failing repeatedly, or the same type of mistake across sessions.
- Propose concrete avoidance rules based on the errors found — these can be added to the project's CLAUDE.md.
- The `kapacitor` CLI must be available on PATH (typically installed at `~/.local/bin/kapacitor`).

## Error Handling

- If the session is not found, the command prints an error and exits with code 1.
- If no errors are found, the command prints "No errors found." — this is a good outcome.
- If the Kurrent Capacitor server is unreachable, the command prints an HTTP error. Ensure the server is running.
