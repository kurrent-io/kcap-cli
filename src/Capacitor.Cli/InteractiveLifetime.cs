///
/// Commands such as <c>setup</c>, <c>login</c>, <c>profile</c>, <c>use</c>,
/// <c>import</c>, and <c>uninstall</c> block on synchronous Spectre.Console
/// prompts (<c>ConfirmationPrompt</c>, <c>SelectionPrompt</c>, <c>TextPrompt</c>).
/// A blocking console read has no timeout and observes neither Ctrl+C nor a
/// detached/closed console, so when the controlling terminal or the launching
/// agent goes away mid-prompt the read never returns and the process is
/// orphaned alive — the reported stray <c>kcap.exe</c> processes left behind
/// after a user abandons <c>kcap setup</c> partway through.
///
/// Redirected/piped stdin is already safe: the prompt read throws
/// "Failed to read input in non-interactive mode" and the process exits. This
/// closes the two gaps that piped stdin doesn't cover:
///   1. Ctrl+C / SIGTERM / SIGHUP while blocked in a prompt.
///   2. The launching parent (shell or coding agent) exiting while we wait for
///      input — a detached pseudo-console delivers no signal at all, so a
///      liveness watchdog is the only thing that reaps it.
///
/// This mirrors what <see cref="Commands.WatchCommand"/> already does for the
/// long-lived watcher; every other interactive command previously had no such
/// protection. Idempotent — safe to call once per process.
