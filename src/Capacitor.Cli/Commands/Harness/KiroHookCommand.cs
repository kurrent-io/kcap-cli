/// <summary>
/// Single-binary dispatcher for AWS Kiro CLI hooks. Kiro (the rebranded
/// Amazon Q Developer CLI) delivers each hook as JSON on STDIN; the kcap
/// installer writes one entry per event with the event name embedded in the
/// command: <c>kcap hook --kiro --event agentSpawn</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Wire contract (Kiro event → server route):
///   agentSpawn → POST /hooks/session-start/kiro, then ensure the watcher is
///                running (vendor=kiro). agentSpawn fires on EVERY prompt with
///                the SAME session id, so the server's deterministic lifecycle
///                event id collapses them to one SessionStarted and the
///                idempotent EnsureWatcherRunning is a no-op once live. The
///                watcher tails Kiro's append-only JSONL session log
///                (~/.kiro/sessions/cli/{id}.jsonl), streams it (vendor=kiro), and
///                — because Kiro has NO session-end hook — synthesizes
///                /hooks/session-end/kiro when it observes the kiro-cli process exit.
///   (any other) → no-op exit 0.
///
/// Kiro appends non-empty hook stdout straight into agent context. That is exactly the
/// team-memory injection channel for <c>agentSpawn</c> — but it is also why every OTHER event
/// here still emits NOTHING (a stdout-writing <c>stop</c> hook re-injects and loops the agent),
/// and why <c>agentSpawn</c>, which fires on EVERY prompt, must inject at most ONCE per session.
/// The raw fragment is written with no JSON envelope and no diagnostics: whatever lands on stdout
/// becomes conversation context verbatim.
