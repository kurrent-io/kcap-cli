/// Dispatcher for Google Antigravity's control hooks. Antigravity is a GUI
/// IDE with no shell hooks; the kcap plugin (a block in Antigravity's <c>hooks.json</c>)
/// registers one command per lifecycle/tool event. Because the JSON payload carries NO
/// event-name field, the event is passed as a positional arg:
///   <c>kcap hook --antigravity &lt;Event&gt;</c>   with the payload on stdin.
///
/// Wire contract (mirrors <see cref="OpenCodeHookCommand"/> — Antigravity likewise has
/// the watcher own session content + session-end): only <c>PreInvocation</c> is
/// actionable — it POSTs /hooks/session-start/antigravity and ensures a watcher is
/// running (vendor=antigravity) tailing the conversation's <c>transcript_full.jsonl</c>.
/// PreInvocation re-fires cheaply on every turn; the server's deterministic lifecycle id
/// collapses the repeats and <see cref="WatcherManager.EnsureWatcherRunning"/> is a no-op
/// once live. Session-end is watcher-owned: Antigravity's IDE process outlives any one
/// conversation (like the Codex desktop), so the watcher self-terminates on idle and
/// POSTs /hooks/session-end/antigravity. <c>Stop</c>/<c>PostInvocation</c>/tool events
/// are no-ops here (the watcher already tails the transcript continuously).
///
/// Fail-open throughout — a kcap/server problem must never disrupt the Antigravity IDE. The
/// session-start POST goes through <see cref="AgentHookPoster.PostOrSpoolAsync(string, string, string, HookSpool, string, string)"/> (Task
/// 6): a lapsed/outage POST is durably spooled for a later drain, and the watcher still spawns
/// (<see cref="SpawnGateForTest"/>) — capture must not depend on lifecycle-POST delivery.
/// Antigravity conversation ids are dashed UUIDs; kcap canonicalizes them to the DASHLESS form
/// for BOTH the session-start payload and the watcher key so they resolve to one stream (the
/// dashed id lives on only in the transcript file path). Historical import canonicalizes the
/// same way, so a conversation captured live and later re-imported dedupes to one stream.
