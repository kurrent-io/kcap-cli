/// <summary>
/// Single-binary dispatcher for Google Gemini CLI hooks. Unlike
/// Copilot, Gemini's command-hook stdin payload carries a uniform
/// <c>hook_event_name</c> (PascalCase: <c>SessionStart</c> / <c>SessionEnd</c> /
/// <c>Notification</c>), so this dispatcher self-routes on it like Claude — the
/// installer registers a single <c>kcap hook --gemini</c> command per event.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Wire contract (Gemini event → server route):
///   SessionStart → POST /hooks/session-start/gemini, then spawn the watcher
///                  tailing the payload's <c>transcript_path</c>
///                  (<c>~/.gemini/tmp/&lt;project&gt;/chats/session-*.jsonl</c>)
///                  with vendor=gemini. Gemini re-fires with source:"resume" on
///                  the same session id and appends to the same transcript file,
///                  so the server's deterministic lifecycle ids make the re-POST
///                  idempotent and the watcher resumes from the server watermark.
///   SessionEnd   → kill watcher + capped inline drain (mirror of the Copilot /
///                  Claude pre-drain cap), then POST /hooks/session-end/gemini.
///   Notification → best-effort forward to the Claude-shaped /hooks/notification.
/// KCAP'S STDERR IS PART OF GEMINI'S HOOK CONTRACT. Gemini treats hook stdout as a
/// JSON decision channel and selects the text to parse as
/// <c>stdout.trim() || stderr.trim()</c> — in a <c>child.on("close")</c> handler
/// that never looks at the event name. So an EMPTY stdout on ANY event makes it
/// parse this process's STDERR as the hook's result, and kcap writes failed-POST,
/// unusable-URL and auth diagnostics there on every event.
///
/// Hence the invariant, enforced structurally by <see cref="Handle"/>'s
/// <c>finally</c> rather than by each path remembering: a RECOGNISED hook firing
/// makes exactly one write ATTEMPT — the memory envelope on SessionStart when there
/// is one, else an explicit <c>{"continue":true}</c>. Only input with no parseable
/// <c>hook_event_name</c> stays silent. Do not add a returning path that skips it,
/// and do not "harmonise" the empty-fragment write away to match the other memory
/// adapters: those harnesses have no such fallback.
///
/// ATTEMPT, not "exactly one object reaches stdout": a throwing writer still consumes
/// the claim. See <see cref="HookResultWriter"/> for the two residues that leaves and
/// why neither is worth retrying.
///
/// The second half of the contract is the EXIT CODE, which is easy to miss because
/// nothing on this path mentions it. Gemini's plain-text fallback (what a stderr
/// string degrades to) is not unconditionally benign: it maps exit 0 and 1 to
/// <c>decision: "allow"</c> but ANY other code to <c>decision: "deny"</c>, which
/// <c>isBlockingDecision()</c> honours — that is a BLOCKED session, not junk
/// context. kcap stays out of that band only because <c>hook</c> is one of
/// <c>CrashReporter.FailOpenCommands</c>, which is what makes every top-level
/// handler in Program.cs return 0 for it. That set is load-bearing here;
/// <c>GeminiHookOutputContractTests</c> pins it.
///
/// Behaviour above is measured on <c>gemini 0.53.0</c> — a version-specific
/// observation, not a guarantee. The mitigation does not depend on it: emitting a
/// valid non-blocking object is correct under any of these selection rules.
