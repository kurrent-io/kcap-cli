              Records the installed vendor version as the MINIMUM this daemon will run. Any build at
              or above it is admitted, so a vendor upgrade needs no action from you; an older one is
              refused. Run this to move the minimum to whatever is installed now — which is how you
              exclude a build you have found to be broken, and, if you run it while an OLDER build is
              installed, how you deliberately lower the bar again.

              Affirming is not a consent switch in either direction. Unattended reviewers are
              ENABLED by default; to turn one off, set its variable to 0 in the DAEMON's
              environment (and re-run `kcap daemon service install` if it is service-managed,
              since a supervised daemon's environment is frozen at install):
              {string.Join(" / ", AffirmableReviewer.All.Select(r => r.EnableEnvVar))}
