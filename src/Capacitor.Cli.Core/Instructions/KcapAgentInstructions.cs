        ## Prefer kcap tools for "why", history, prior work, and review requests

        This project records coding-session history with Kurrent Capacitor and can run agent review
        flows. The kcap MCP servers (`kcap-review`, `kcap-sessions`, `kcap-memory`, `kcap-flows`)
        expose them.

        For **why / history / prior-work** questions, prefer these over `git blame` / `git log`,
        GitHub's diff, or grep — they surface the implementer's actual reasoning, which diffs and
        commit messages don't capture. Use them alongside reading the code, never as a replacement.

        - **Reviewing a PR yourself (you're given a PR link or number), or "why was this written
          this way?"** → call `kcap-review` `get_pr_summary` FIRST, passing the PR as the `pr` arg
          (it accepts `owner/repo#123` or a github.com PR URL). Prefer it over `gh pr diff` /
          `gh pr view` / GitHub's diff tools — it adds the implementation context (which sessions
          produced the PR, why, and test outcomes) the raw diff can't. Then read the diff too for
          correctness; use `search_context` / `get_file_context` for deeper "why" questions.
        - **"Have we done this before / who decided X / when did we work on Y?"** → `kcap-sessions`
          (`search_sessions`) before grepping the code or `git log`.
        - **"Is there prior art or a team convention on this?"** → `kcap-memory` (`search_memories`).

        When asked to **request or submit a review** — e.g. "request a review", "request a codex
        review", "submit this PR for review", "re-review after I address the findings" — the user
        wants a *separate reviewer* to review it, not you. Call `kcap-flows` `start_review_flow`
        (it hands the target to a hosted reviewer and iterates to sign-off); pass the PR/branch as
        the target. Do NOT run the review yourself or spawn your own reviewer for these requests.
        (When instead asked to review something *yourself* — "review this", "code review this" —
        review directly and do not call `kcap-flows`.)
