/// <para><b>Lives in Core because three projects need the same list</b> and they cannot see each
/// other: the daemon reads <see cref="EnableEnvVar"/> to build its config, the CLI carries it into a
/// service unit, and the CLI's <c>daemon reviewer affirm</c> verb resolves a vendor by name.

/// and a vendor that appears in the daemon's apply loop but not in the service-unit allowlist is a
/// reviewer that cannot be disabled on the supported install path — the exact hazard review raised.
/// While these were opt-INs the same drift meant a reviewer that could not be turned ON: annoying, and
/// safe. Two enumerations that must agree, with nothing making them, is the shape that produces that;
