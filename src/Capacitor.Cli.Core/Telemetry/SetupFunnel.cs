/// The signup funnel: `kcap setup` -> sign-in -> "no tenant" -> workspace offer -> outcome ->
/// setup success. Every event flushes eagerly via <see cref="CliTelemetry.CaptureNow"/> EXCEPT
/// the provisioning/poll outcomes (<see cref="WorkspaceProvisioned"/>, <see cref="WorkspaceFailed"/>):
/// abandonment happens before commitment, and the population this exists to measure abandons
/// setup there and never runs kcap again, so a deferred event at that point is a lost event, not
/// a delayed one.
///
/// The two outcome events are the exception: neither can be reached by walking away from a prompt,
/// so both arrive at the process's normal exit flush. They use the batched
/// <see cref="CliTelemetry.Capture"/> path instead — they don't need the eager flush, and eager
/// flushing would block synchronously inside SpectreTenantProvisioner's interactive prompts and
/// (for the poll outcomes) inside a Spectre live-display callback, neither of which tolerates
/// blocking work without garbling what it is drawing.
///
/// <see cref="WorkspaceFailed"/> does NOT imply a preceding <see cref="WorkspaceRequested"/>: the
/// flag-driven create rejects a bad or taken slug before asking the server for anything. Those
/// carry the reason the check produced (<c>invalid</c>, <c>blocked</c>, <c>reserved</c>,
/// <c>taken</c>, <c>unavailable</c>, <c>availability_unreachable</c>), so a funnel query can tell
/// them from a failure that had a workspace on the way.
///
/// Names deliberately avoid `cli_setup_completed`, which the SERVER already emits — a second
/// producer of that name would double-count across two different persons (the CLI user and
/// whoever the server attributes the event to).
