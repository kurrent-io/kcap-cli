/// protocol layer).
///
/// <para><b>Why this is much simpler than <see cref="AntigravityHostedAgentRuntime"/>.</b> agy has
/// no process between turns, which is why it needs an explicit phase machine to answer "is this
/// runtime alive". Pi's child is LONG-LIVED — ONE <c>pi</c> process backs the whole hosted session,
/// its stdin stays open for that session's whole life — so liveness is REAL:
/// <see cref="HasExited"/>/<see cref="ExitCode"/>/<see cref="Pid"/> all delegate straight to the
/// process, and there is no phase to keep in sync with it. What this class owns instead is the
/// stdio protocol: one read pump, command/response correlation by <c>id</c>, and the transcript
/// translation.</para>
///
/// <para><b>(a) The ready barrier is the load-bearing invariant.</b> The constructor sends
/// <c>get_state</c> (id <see cref="InitStateCommandId"/>) and
/// <see cref="WaitForSessionReadyAsync"/> completes when its response resolves
/// <see cref="AcpSessionId"/> and <see cref="ResolvedModel"/>. A factory MUST await it before
/// returning control to the orchestrator, which reads <see cref="AcpSessionId"/> synchronously the
/// moment a launch returns — binding a transcript to <c>""</c> is a silent, permanent correlation
/// break, not a flaky race (the same rule <see cref="AntigravityHostedAgentRuntime"/>'s rule (e)
/// documents at length). The barrier is only usable because it resolves on EVERY path: the
/// response arrives (success), the response says <c>success:false</c> or carries no
/// <c>sessionId</c> (fault — fail closed rather than bind <c>""</c>), the child exits or its stdout
/// EOFs (fault, via <see cref="EnterTerminal"/>), the write itself fails (fault), or the deadline
/// elapses (fault). A hanging barrier wedges the launch path; a faulted one merely fails a launch.</para>
///
/// <para>That last path is why the deadline is NOT optional. A caller may override it, but it
/// always applies — <see cref="DefaultReadyDeadline"/> backs an omitted one. Every other path
/// needs the child to DO something (answer, refuse, or die); an alive-but-silent child — spawned,
/// hung before its first read, never exiting — does none of them, so a null deadline would leave
/// that one shape with no resolver at all. A launch path that hangs only when a callsite forgot to
/// pass a timeout is the exact failure this barrier exists to prevent, arriving through the
/// barrier's own configuration.</para>
///
/// <para><b>(b) <see cref="ReadOutputAsync"/> parks on one signal, created once.</b> Same rule as
/// Antigravity's (c): the orchestrator drives <c>FinalizeAgentRunAsync</c> from that stream's
/// <c>await foreach</c> ending, so <see cref="_terminalTcs"/> is a single constructor-owned
/// <see cref="TaskCompletionSource"/> completed exactly once, on entry to terminal — never a
/// per-turn signal. Pi's stdout is protocol traffic, never terminal bytes, so
/// <see cref="EmitsTerminalOutput"/> is <see langword="false"/> and this stream yields no bytes at
/// all.</para>
///
/// <para><b>(c) The user-echo dedupe.</b> <see cref="SendUserInputAsync"/> emits the
/// <c>user_message</c> envelope itself, at send time, so the viewer sees their message immediately
/// rather than only once Pi echoes it back. Pi then ALSO reports that same text as a user-role
/// <c>message_end</c>, so without a dedupe every hosted message renders twice. Sent prompts are
/// remembered in a bounded (<see cref="SentPromptMemory"/>), most-recent-first, CONSUME-on-match
/// list, and the match is applied BEFORE the envelope reaches the channel. Consume-on-match (rather
/// than a contains-check) is what keeps a genuinely repeated message renderable: sending "again"
/// twice must show two user messages, and a non-consuming filter would swallow the second
/// forever.</para>
