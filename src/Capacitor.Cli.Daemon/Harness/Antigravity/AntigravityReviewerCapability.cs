/// <summary>
/// Whether THIS daemon may run Antigravity's CLI (<c>agy</c>) as an unattended review-flow reviewer.
/// Pure, so every arm is testable without a vendor or a process.
///
/// <para><b>ENABLED by default; the switch is an opt-OUT.</b> An unattended reviewer runs in a
/// daemon-owned worktree under a per-launch, owner-only <c>HOME</c>, and its findings text is returned
/// to whoever requested the review — a cross-principal risk that lands on the daemon OPERATOR. It used
/// to be an opt-in on that basis. It is not any more, because the reviewer vendor is caller-chosen and
/// Claude, Codex, Cursor and Copilot have never been gated, each with the same authority: on a daemon
/// that also ADVERTISES one of those, the gate did not widen the capability class a requester could
/// reach, and cost the operator a service-unit edit. On a daemon advertising only gated vendors it did
/// separate the hosted role from the unattended reviewer role, and the flip genuinely widens what a
/// non-operator can cause to run with no human in the loop. Deliberately still NOT Kiro's
/// whole-filesystem-read paragraph — that claim is about a trusted <c>fs_read</c> primitive this vendor
/// does not expose, and a borrowed risk statement would be false in either direction.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The disabled arm is the ONE that is reviewer-only</b> (see
/// <c>AntigravityHostedAgentRuntimeFactory.LaunchRefusal</c>'s parameter doc). The paragraph above is
/// exactly why: the risk it describes is cross-principal, and a HOSTED launch has no counterpart —
/// the server resolves a launch's daemon with the caller's own user id, so the launcher is the
/// daemon's owner. Hosted Antigravity has always shipped on; every other arm below gates both.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a version MINIMUM.</b> Containment here is source suppression — an empty per-launch
/// <see cref="AntigravityReviewerHome"/> in place of the operator's own <c>~/.gemini</c>, whose kcap
/// capture plugin would otherwise fire against the conversation this runtime is already recording.
/// That is a HOSTED concern as much as a reviewer one, which is why this arm is not parameterised.
/// That the build honours <c>HOME</c> and reads no other global config source is a behaviour of the
/// BUILD, not of this repository. The recorded value is the OLDEST build this daemon will run: an
/// upgrade needs no action — which matters more here than for any sibling, since <c>agy</c> was
/// observed auto-updating itself mid-session (1.1.8 → 1.1.10) — a downgrade below it is refused, and
/// a build later found to be bad is excluded by raising the floor past it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why that record is state and not configuration.</b> An earlier revision of this gate read
/// the floor from <c>KCAP_ANTIGRAVITY_MIN_CLI_VERSION</c>. A value the operator could set from a shell
/// profile would be re-affirmed by their dotfiles rather than by them — the same "consent that isn't
/// consent" failure the enable flag exists to avoid. Kiro and Gemini use the same model; the shared
/// comparison lives in <see cref="Core.ReviewerVersionAffirmations"/> and the record in
/// <see cref="Core.ReviewerVersionStore"/>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>This is the whole ladder</b> (consent → platform → build), and
/// <c>AntigravityHostedAgentRuntimeFactory.LaunchRefusal</c> is its only production caller: it adds
/// the one arm this decision cannot express — a binary that does not resolve at all — and takes every
/// other verdict, and every text, from here. Both the advertisement seam and the launch boundary read
/// that one method, so the minimum cannot be enforced at only one of them, and the hosted/review
/// difference is a PARAMETER of that method rather than a second ladder that must agree with it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The denial texts below are read by both launch shapes</b> (consent excepted, which only a
/// review can reach), so they describe the containment rather than the reviewer — a hosted operator
/// must never be sent to the reviewer consent flag by a version arm.</para>
