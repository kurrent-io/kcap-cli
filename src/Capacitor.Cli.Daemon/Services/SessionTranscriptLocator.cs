/// Claude Code project directory for the transcript file the agent writes.
///
/// Why this exists: the web chat can only attach to a hosted agent once the server's
/// registry entry has a SessionId, and until now the ONLY source of that link was the
/// spawned Claude's session-start hook POSTing to <c>/hooks/session-start</c>. When that
/// hook fails (e.g. an expired kcap token → 401), the link is never made and the agent
/// page shows "Waiting for session to start..." forever even though the terminal works.
/// The daemon itself can make the link instead: Claude Code writes its transcript to
/// <c>{ClaudePaths.Projects}/{project-dir-hash}/{session-id}.jsonl</c>, so polling that
/// directory and reporting the discovered id over the daemon's own (authenticated)
/// SignalR connection is a hook-independent fallback.
///
/// Disambiguation: the daemon symlinks the worktree's project dir to the SOURCE repo's
/// project dir (see <c>ClaudeLauncher.SymlinkClaudeProjectDir</c>), which is shared with
/// the user's own sessions in that repo — so a new <c>.jsonl</c> there is not necessarily
/// this agent's. Candidates are verified by reading the first lines of the file and
/// requiring the JSON <c>"cwd"</c> field to equal the agent's worktree path (the worktree
/// is created per-agent, so a cwd match is definitive).

/// is pure and unit-tested without a filesystem; only <see cref="TryLocate"/> touches disk.
