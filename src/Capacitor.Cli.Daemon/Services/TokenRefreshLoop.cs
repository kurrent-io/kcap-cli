/// <para><b>Rate limiting.</b> A refresh ATTEMPT (success or failure) arms a
/// <c>minAttemptInterval</c> gate; ticks inside that gate are skipped without touching the
/// endpoint. This bounds refresh traffic in the cases where the token keeps landing back
/// inside the window every tick — a refresh that fails (dead / rotated refresh token, server
/// down) leaves the expiry unchanged, and a provider that issues a token whose whole lifetime
/// is shorter than the window (or <see cref="TokenStore.JwtExpiry"/>'s parse-failure fallback)
/// puts the freshly-refreshed token right back inside it. A no-op (NotDue) tick is not an
/// attempt and never arms the gate, so a healthy long-lived token is still refreshed promptly
/// the moment it enters the window.</para>
