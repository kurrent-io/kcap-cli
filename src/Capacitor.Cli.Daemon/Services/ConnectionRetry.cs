/// <summary>
/// Retries a hub invocation across transient connection drops. Used by
/// <see cref="ServerConnection.RequestPermissionAsync"/> so a SignalR blip
/// during a (potentially hours-long) permission wait doesn't surface to the
/// caller as a failure — and therefore doesn't get turned into a silent deny.
///
/// Every attempt — including the first — waits until the connection is ready
/// (Connected AND re-registered) before invoking, so a request that arrives
/// mid-reconnect can't fire against a connection the server hasn't registered.
/// Because of that gating, a failure is a transient disconnect when it is an
/// <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/> (SignalR cancels in-flight
/// invocations when the transport drops) or an
/// <see cref="InvalidOperationException"/> ("connection is not active" — the
/// transport went down in the gap between the readiness check and the call).
/// Both are retried. Every other exception — <c>HubException</c> (server
/// rejected) or anything unrecognized — propagates to the caller (→ the bridge
/// denies).
///
/// The transient-disconnect loop is bounded only by <paramref name="ct"/> (daemon shutdown). The
/// caller's shutdown token is excluded from the transient classification, so a
/// shutdown <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/> propagates rather than
/// being retried.
///
/// A caller may additionally supply <paramref name="isRetriableServerError"/> +
/// <paramref name="maxServerErrorRetries"/> to retry a BOUNDED number of times on specific
/// server-rejection exceptions (AI-864: the "Caller is not the daemon owning session"
/// <c>HubException</c> that can appear briefly after a reconnect, before per-agent
/// re-registration has restored ownership — retrying past that window avoids a spurious deny).
/// Unlike transient disconnects, these retries are capped so a genuinely-permanent server error
/// still surfaces (→ deny) instead of looping forever.
