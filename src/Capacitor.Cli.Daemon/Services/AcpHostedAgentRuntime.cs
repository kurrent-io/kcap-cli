/// notifications to <see cref="AcpSessionUpdate"/> DTOs, surfaced via <see cref="Updates"/> for

/// the real bridge). Local-attach (raw byte input) and terminal output are PTY-only surfaces the
/// ACP runtime does not support until a follow-up adds a terminal capability.
///
/// Also owns a serialized, single-flight prompt-turn worker (<see cref="RunTurnWorkerAsync"/>/
/// <see cref="ProcessAdmittedTurnAsync"/>) and a chunk aggregator (<see cref="AggregateUpdate"/>) that
/// together turn the raw <c>session/update</c> stream into an ORDERED, per-turn-aggregated
/// <see cref="AcpEventEnvelope"/> transcript, exposed via <see cref="IAcpTranscriptSource"/> for the
/// orchestrator to bind and forward. Prompt turns (the initial launch prompt, and every
/// <see cref="SendUserInputAsync"/>) are enqueued onto a FIFO
/// queue rather than fired as independent background work, so exactly one turn's chunks are ever
/// aggregating at a time — a `stopReason` always flushes the buffer belonging to ITS OWN turn, never
/// a concurrently-fired one. See <see cref="_aggregationLock"/>'s remarks for the thread-safety
/// mechanism between the worker's turn-end flush and the connection read-loop's kind-transition
/// flush.

/// For an eligible launch (constructed with an <see cref="AcpReconnectSupport"/>) the runtime also
