/// <c>session/new</c> → <c>session/prompt</c> handshake and reduces inbound <c>session/update</c>
/// notifications to <see cref="AcpSessionUpdate"/> DTOs, surfaced via <see cref="Updates"/> for
/// the mapper to turn into canonical events. Scope stops there — no canonical events, no
/// permission bridge (<c>OnServerRequest</c> stays unset, so the connection's default-decline
/// posture answers any inbound server request with a method-not-found error; a follow-up wires
/// the real bridge). Local-attach (raw byte input) and terminal output are PTY-only surfaces the
/// ACP runtime does not support until a follow-up adds a terminal capability.
///
/// Also owns a serialized, single-flight prompt-turn worker (<see cref="RunTurnWorkerAsync"/>/
/// <see cref="ProcessTurnAsync"/>) and a chunk aggregator (<see cref="AggregateUpdate"/>) that
/// together turn the raw <c>session/update</c> stream into an ORDERED, per-turn-aggregated

/// aggregating at a time — a `stopReason` always flushes the buffer belonging to ITS OWN turn, never
/// a concurrently-fired one. See <see cref="_aggregationLock"/>'s remarks for the thread-safety
