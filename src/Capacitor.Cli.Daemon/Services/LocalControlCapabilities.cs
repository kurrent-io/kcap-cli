/// The daemon's advertised local-control capability list, surfaced on <c>HelloReply</c>.
/// INVARIANT: an entry may exist here ONLY if <see cref="LocalControlServer"/> actually
/// routes the corresponding frame(s) to a real handler — this list is assembled right next
/// to that routing switch so a capability can never be advertised without behavior behind
/// it. Every entry's handler is live in this build: <c>"consent/1"</c> routes
/// ConsentSubscribe/ConsentResolve/ConsentRulesGet/ConsentRulesPut to <see cref="LaunchConsentIpc"/>;
/// <c>"consent/2"</c> routes ConsentSubscribeV2/ConsentResolveV2 to the same handler with
/// identity-checked resolution (mandatory <c>prompt_id</c> echo), <c>rule_saved</c> acks, and
/// <c>prompt_id</c>/<c>requester_display</c>-stamped pendings; <c>"consent/3"</c> routes
/// ConsentRulesPutV2 to the same handler, gating the policy replacement on an
/// ExpectedName/ExpectedServerUrl identity echo (ack is the existing ConsentAck, with the coded
/// <c>identity_mismatch</c> error on mismatch and nothing mutated). Both v2 entries are discovery
/// only — enforcement lives in the v2 frames themselves. <c>"status/1"</c> routes StatusSubscribe
/// to <see cref="DaemonStatusIpc"/>; <c>"permission/1"</c> routes
/// PermissionSubscribe/PermissionResolve to <see cref="PermissionIpc"/>; and <c>"input/1"</c>
/// routes SendText to <see cref="AgentOrchestrator.HandleLocalSendTextAsync"/>.
