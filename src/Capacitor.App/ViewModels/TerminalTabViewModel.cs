/// One terminal tab: resolves the agent's terminal capability against the daemon's Agents cache,
/// then drives the attach/reattach/detach lifecycle over ITerminalAttachClient. Constructed once
/// per tab (like HomeViewModel/ActivityViewModel), not gated behind IActivatableViewModel — the
/// resolve gate and the Agents-cache watch must be live from construction, and TeardownAsync
/// (not Dispose/WhenActivated) is the one lifecycle exit a tab tracker calls when the tab closes.
///
/// State machine (TerminalSessionPhase): Resolving -> {NoTerminal | NotFound | Connecting} ->
/// {Attached -> Detached/Exited/Failed/SessionEnded}. Two independent linearizations guard it:
///
/// * Resolve gate (_resolveState, CAS 0 pending/1 dto-won/2 timeout-won/3 disposed): the FIRST of
///   {a DTO observed, the 10s TimeProvider timeout, TeardownAsync} wins; the loser no-ops. A
///   timeout-win disposes the Agents subscription outright (a late DTO then has nothing to reach
///   -- RetryResolveCommand is the only way back in). A dto-win leaves the subscription alive so a
///   LATER removal can still render SessionEnded.
/// * Attempt lifecycle (_attemptGeneration): every attach/reattach bumps it; a completion whose
///   captured generation no longer matches the current one is a retired attempt and mutates
///   nothing (silent, not an error). _attachLane (SemaphoreSlim(1,1), TRY-entered via Wait(0) --
///   never awaited) single-flights the swap: two ReattachCommand.Execute() calls issued before the
///   first has reached its own await point collapse to exactly one new client, because
///   ReactiveCommand.Execute() invokes its Func&lt;Task&gt; eagerly, without consulting
///   CanExecute/IsExecuting, so a queueing WaitAsync() here would let a double-click spawn two
///   real clients.
///   A call that loses the try-enter is a clean no-op, not a queued retry.
/// * Send gate (_openingToken): who may accept composer text. BeginAttempt and Invalidate are its
///   only advances, and both the gate and the in-flight flag are DERIVED from ownership
///   (_gateOpenToken / _sendInFlightToken == _openingToken), so an advance settles them with
///   nothing to remember and no window in which a passed token check still sets one. A publish that is not an attempt's own Connecting/Attached invalidates -- a
///   terminal outcome only while its OWN attempt still holds the token, since a reattach takes
///   its token before it disposes the client whose outcome it is retiring. State has one
///   assignment site, Publish, which applies both rules.
///
/// UI affinity: the resolve gate mutates State after ObserveOn(RxSchedulers.MainThreadScheduler)
/// or RxSchedulers.MainThreadScheduler.Schedule(...) (the TimeProvider timer fires off-thread in
/// production, synchronously on the CALLING thread under FakeTimeProvider.Advance -- Schedule onto
/// MainThreadScheduler is what makes that synchronous under WithImmediateRxScheduler too). Every
/// attempt-lifecycle mutation (the swap, OnAttached/OnOutput's Feed, the outcome mapping) goes
/// through Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync awaited with the attempt's own token -- these arrive
/// from the attach client's own async continuations, which carry no Rx scheduler affinity at all.
