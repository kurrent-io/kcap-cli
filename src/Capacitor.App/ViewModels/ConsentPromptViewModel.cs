/// conclusive acks and the prune do that inside ConsentService, and its identity guard
/// makes any stale action a no-op.
///
/// Five honesty rules:
///
/// * <b>Expiry is never a verdict.</b> The deadline hint is wall-clock and the daemon's deadline is
///   monotonic, so a hint that reached zero proves nothing. The countdown line says so and the
///   buttons stay ACTIVE — a click after zero either applies normally (backward clock step) or
///   comes back Ok=false and runs the honest "Already decided" path.
/// * <b>An in-flight resolve outranks the clock.</b> Past zero mid-call the line reads "Expiring…"
///   and the phase stays Resolving: the ack, not the hint, settles the request.
/// * <b>A transport failure discloses nothing about the rule.</b> Its outcome carries a rule value
///   that was never sent, so this path shows only the transport toast, re-enables the buttons and
///   keeps the entry.
/// * <b>A warning outlives the decision that raised it.</b> A toast posted on the same beat the
///   window closes is never seen, so a rule-not-saved disclosure with nothing left to advance to
///   holds the window for the terminal hold instead of closing under its own toast.
/// * <b>Only a DECISION closes the window on the spot.</b> A queue the cache emptied — a
///   resubscribe's clear, whose replay arrives as a separate changeset — waits one beat before
///   closing, so a reconnect blip does not flicker the window shut and rebuild it (see
///   Advance).
